3. **Teaching** - Your educational impact
4. **Academic Journey** - Your educational background
5. **Contact** - Ways to collaborate

The removal of specific project listings creates a cleaner, more streamlined portfolio that emphasizes your overall research approach and published work rather than individual ongoing projects.

## üöÄ Next Steps

If you want to add back specific content:
- Research highlights can be added to the Research Philosophy section
