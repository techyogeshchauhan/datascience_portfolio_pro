# Text Justification Fixes Applied

## Overview
All paragraph text across the portfolio has been properly justified to ensure clean, professional alignment with text extending to both left and right margins.

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. **CSS Enhancement**
Added proper text justification rules to `css/tailwind.css`:
