In both R2F and PdM we have the data related to the maintenance cycle. In case of Preventive Maintenance (PvM) complete information about maintenance cycle is not available. Among these three maintenance policies, predictive Maintenance (PdM) is becoming a very important strategy as it can help us to minimize the repair time and the associated cost with it. In this paper we have proposed PdM, which allows the dynamic decision rules for the maintenance management. PdM is achieved by training the machine learning model with the datasets. It also helps in planning of maintenance schedules. We specially focused on two models that are Binary Classification and Recurrent Neural Network. In Binary Classification we classify whether our data belongs to the failure class or the non failure class. In Binary Classification the number of cycles is entered and classification model predicts whether it belongs to the failure/non failure class.</jats:p>",

Our objectives were to predict probabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments, validate model predictions, and examine them for biases. Data from 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major depression from antidepressant clinical trials were standardized into a common framework and feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables. Using Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training set and refined using the validation set. On the held-out test set, the model demonstrated an AUC of 0.65 and outperformed a null model (p = 0.01). The model demonstrated clinical utility, achieving an absolute improvement in population remission rate in hypothetical and actual improvement testing. While the model identified escitalopram as generally outperforming other drugs (consistent with the input data), there was otherwise significant variation in drug rankings. The model did not amplify potentially harmful biases. We demonstrate the first model capable of predicting outcomes for 10 treatments, intended to be used at or near the start of treatment to personalize treatment; AID-ME cluster randomized trial results are reported separately.</p>",

People are becoming worse because they don't regularly attend the hospital for checkups due to job and unanticipated events. Most people nowadays suffer from one or more chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, heart disease, breast cancer, and dermatology. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these chronic illnesses account for half of all fatalities in most nations and are the main cause of premature mortality. Patients who are identified early on potentially have their condition stop progressing. Many dispersed studies clearly demonstrated that conventional approaches to diagnosing chronic illnesses are prone to prejudice and heterogeneity among physicians, making it difficult to promptly and precisely diagnose problems. Still, Despite the availability of up-to-date information and a variety of machine learning-based methods, there have been enormous published efforts demonstrating that machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) based approach can considerably enhance the timely estimation of various health conditions. However, precise diagnosis of such diseases remains a difficulty. There are many machine learning-based techniques and current knowledge available, however despite this, a great deal of published research has shown that machine learning/deep learning based approach can considerably enhance the timely estimation of various health conditions. However, precise diagnosis of such diseases remains a difficulty. In order to tackle this problem, this work uses the UCI/KAGGLE ML/DL disease dataset to evaluate various ML/DL procedures and explores how different machine learning algorithms forecast chronic diseases. Accuracy and confusion matrix are used to verify the results. In order to help inexperienced researchers comprehend the disease prediction function of ML/DL-based techniques and determine the direction of Upcoming research, this study also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of accessible disease prediction schemes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Breast cancer is the widest spreading disease among women globally. The prevalence rate of breast cancer continued to rise in the last few decades. The mitotic count is a relevant factor for grading invasive breast cancer. Early analysis is an extremely imperative step in treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several skepticisms in detection which employ mammograms. Since it is subject to human prone error, requires more time for completion and the nuclei look similar during all stages of mitosis, automatic detection of mitosis is a good solution to overcome these problems. Detailed analysis of breast cancer normally requires medical images of different methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis largely depend on the experiences of the radiologists, and uncertain diagnosis is quite frequent because of resolution limitations and the concerns of lawsuits arisen from wrong diagnosis or undetected lesions. In this paper, the top methodologies used for mitosis detection are analyzed. There are many algorithms for classification and prediction of breast cancer: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (CART), k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Bayesian Networks (BN). The Wisconsin data set was used to analyze breast cancer as a training set to assess and measure the performance of the three ML classifiers in terms of key frameworks such as accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC. The outcome obtained in this paper provides a critique of the stateofart ML techniques for breast cancer detection. It was also found that the ensemble classifier gives better performance. A preliminary experiment conducted on cascaded RF and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) results in better accuracy than individual classifiers. The paper shows how we can use deep learning technology diagnosis of breast cancer using MIAS Dataset. A deep learning approach is almost used for immense task objective Image processing, Computer Vision, Medical Diagnosis, and Neural Language Processing.</jats:p>",

Here's a general outline of how you could approach this problem: Data Collection: Gather historical crime data from reliable sources such as government databases, law enforcement agencies, and crime statistics repositories. This data should include information about Preparing crime data for analysis involves various steps, including handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. This ensures data consistency and readiness for analysis. The data typically includes information about the type of crime, location (place, date, and time), population, area, socioeconomic factors, weather, and other relevant variables and handling outliers. Feature Selection/Engineering: Identify which features (variables) are likely to have the most impact on crime rates. Feature engineering might involve creating new variables from existing ones or transforming variables to make them more informative. Conducting involves delving into the dataset to gain valuable insights and performing thorough data analysis to better understand the data the relationships between different features and crime rates. Visualization techniques can help you understand patterns, correlations, and potential outliers in the data Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning and deep learning models for the prediction task. For crime rate prediction, you could consider time series models (ARIMA, LSTM, GRU), and ensemble techniques. In a sample exercise, you would typically split the data into training and testing sets, often organized into batches. You then choose specific models, train them on the training data, and work on enhancing their performance by adjusting hyper parameters as needed. For deep learning models, this might involve selecting the architecture, tuning the number of layers and units, and adjusting learning rates. When evaluating models, you can employ various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess their performance accurately. These metrics help in measuring the quality of trained models effectively. possibly more domain-specific metrics. Interpretability: If using complex models like deep learning, consider methods to interpret and explain the model's predictions. Methods such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) are useful for gaining insights into the influential factors behind model predictions. These techniques aid in understanding the driving factors behind model predictions. Fine-tuning and Iteration: Based on the evaluation results, refine your models and pre-process the data further if necessary. This might involve experimenting with different features, models, or data manipulation techniques. Deployment: After achieving satisfactory model performance, you can apply it to make predictions on new data. This process can be facilitated through a user-friendly interface, whether it involves creating a new system or integrating the model into an existing one, in cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix.

Two models were created: one trained with data from low-rated schools and tested on both low- and high-rated schools, achieving 85.7% and 83.3% accuracy, respectively. The second model, trained with high-rated school data, yielded 88.9% accuracy for high-rated schools but only 35.7% for low-rated ones.

The well-known efficient market hypothesis believes in the impossibility of accurate prediction of future stock prices in an efficient stock market as the stock prices are assumed to be purely stochastic. However, numerous works proposed by researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to predict future stock prices with a high level of precision using sophisticated algorithms, model architectures, and the selection of appropriate variables in the models. This chapter proposes a collection of predictive regression models built on deep learning architecture for robust and precise prediction of the future prices of a stock listed in the diversified sectors in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The Metastock tool is used to download the historical stock prices over a period of two years (2013–2014) at 5 minutes intervals. While the records for the first year are used to train the models, the testing is carried out using the remaining records. The design approaches of all the models and their performance results are presented in detail. The models are also compared based on their execution time and accuracy of prediction.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Software defect prediction is a significant activity in every software firm. It helps in producing quality software by reliable defect prediction, defect elimination, and prediction of modules that are susceptible to defect. Several researchers have proposed different software prediction approaches in the past. However, these conventional software defect predictions are prone to low classification accuracy, time-consuming, and tasking. This paper aims to develop a novel multi-model ensemble machine-learning for software defect prediction. The ensemble technique can reduce inconsistency among training and test datasets and eliminate bias in the training and testing phase of the model, thereby overcoming the downsides that have characterized the existing techniques used for the prediction of a software defect. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new ensemble machine-learning model for software defect prediction using k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization (GLMNet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Random Forest as base learner. Experiments were conducted using the proposed model on CM1, JM1, KC3, and PC3 datasets from the NASA PROMISE repository using the RStudio simulation tool. The ensemble technique achieved 87.69% for CM1 dataset, 81.11% for JM1 dataset, 90.70% for PC3 dataset, and 94.74% for KC3 dataset. The performance of the proposed system was compared with that of other existing techniques in literature in terms of AUC. The ensemble technique achieved 87%, which is better than the other seven state-of-the-art techniques under consideration. On average, the proposed model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 88.56% for all datasets used for experiments. The results demonstrated that the ensemble model succeeded in effectively predicting the defects in PROMISE datasets that are notorious for their noisy features and high dimensions. This shows that ensemble machine learning is promising and the future of software defect prediction.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Background and Objectives: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and agitation. MDD is the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet it is still largely underdiagnosed due to misinterpretation of behavioral symptoms. Despite growing evidence implicating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of genes linked to psychiatric disorders, few computational tools exist to reliably classify miRNAs as being associated with depression. This study presents a novel quantum machine learning approach to predict whether dysregulation of specific miRNAs is linked to depression. Methods: We used web scraping to create a dataset of sequence attributes, predicted gene target attributes, and predicted pathways attributes for 54 miRNAs frequently dysregulated in MDD patients and 54 randomly selected miRNAs. The dataset was limited to the most important attributes for classification using feature selection. Results: A quantum classifier was then built with 7 qubits, achieving an accuracy of 90%, and a Multilayer Perceptron model was built, achieving an accuracy of 87%. The role of cancer pathways was also implicated in MDD development. Discussion: This work represents one of the first applications of quantum machine learning to depression biomarker classification and provides proof of concept for its use in more complex mental health diagnostics. The quantum classifier not only handles entangled feature space and non-linear relationships to uncover patterns inaccessible to classical algorithms but also provides a real-world benchmark for using quantum computing in machine learning.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the growing intricacy and lack of transparency of these technologies have led to important worries about their reliability and ethical consequences. This research explores the growing area of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that seeks to improve the clarity, comprehensibility, and responsibility of AI, ML, and deep learning models. XAI helps to increase trust and acceptance by making these technologies easier to understand for users and stakeholders, therefore tackling the \"black box\" issue. This research provides a thorough examination of the most recent approaches and structures in XAI, with a focus on important strategies like model-agnostic explanations, interpretable models, and post-hoc interpretability techniques. It also examines the important function of XAI in guaranteeing adherence to regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, which are becoming stricter globally. Moreover, the review assesses how XAI is incorporated into different fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, illustrating its ability to reduce biases, enhance decision-making, and increase user confidence. This research highlights the significance of XAI in creating AI systems that are both strong and ethical by discussing current trends and developments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<p>Abstract — This chapter reviews deep learning models previously used to identify neuro-biomarkers related to major depressive disorder in adults and children, detailing the outcomes of prior research and current advancements in this field. In addition, this chapter explores the use of convolutional neural networks to classify and detect neuro-biomarkers associated with major depressive disorder in comparison to age-matched healthy individuals. Specifically, convolutional neural networks, utilizing the visual geometry group (VGG16) and DeprNet models were applied to analyze resting-state, eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) data. The EEG data undergoes thorough pre-processing, and deep learning modules are employed to facilitate the understanding and analysis of the data. These techniques aim to extract neuro-biomarkers of interest within each frequency band and across various regions of interest, striving to develop a robust and generic method for interpreting the model's \"black box.\" The approach used in this research incorporates several robust scoring methods, addresses data imbalance, manages the limited data availability, and optimizes the hyper-parameters of these deep learning models.</p>",

Traditional diagnostic methods frequently involve invasive and expensive imaging techniques. This study aims to develop a non-invasive, real-time prediction system for osteoarthritis using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a robust machine learning approach. The core of this system is its ability to accurately and comprehensively collect sensor data from the user's joints. The system integrates a variety of non-invasive sensors, including flex sensors, MPU6050 sensors, and piezoelectric sensors, interfaced with a Node MCU microcontroller. The data from these sensors is transmitted to the cloud and analyzed using the KNN algorithm to predict the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The KNN algorithm is applied to classify individuals into different osteoarthritis risk categories. This non-invasive, portable, and efficient solution offers a promising alternative to traditional diagnostic methods, making osteoarthritis prediction more accessible and cost-effective.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "Depression is an increasingly common mental health condition worldwide and is influenced by various factors such as anxiety, frustration, obesity, medical issues, etc. In severe cases, it can even result in suicide. This study aimed to utilize machine learning (ML) models to categorize and forecast student depression. The research involved analyzing a dataset of 787 college students through a series of steps, including cleansing, model training, and testing using techniques to classify and predict student depression. Three ML models were employed: logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT). The findings revealed that the LR model achieved the highest accuracy in prediction, with a rate of 77%, 70% recall, and 72% F1 score. Moreover, the study highlighted that two out of five students experience mild depression, around 90% of depressed students do not seek treatment, obese students are 2.5 times more prone to depression, male students are twice as likely to be obese, and male students generally have a higher body mass index (BMI) compared to female students. The study concludes that integrating ML models into the triggers that lead to depression among students.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background Cervical cancer is a common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system and is considered a leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. The analysis of time to event, which is crucial for any clinical research, can be well done with the method of survival prediction. This study aims to systematically investigate the use of machine learning to predict survival in patients with cervical cancer. Method An electronic search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was performed on October 1, 2022. All articles extracted from the databases were collected in an Excel file and duplicate articles were removed. The articles were screened twice based on the title and the abstract and checked again with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main inclusion criterion was machine learning algorithms for predicting cervical cancer survival. The information extracted from the articles included authors, publication year, dataset details, survival type, evaluation criteria, machine learning models, and the algorithm execution method. Results A total of 13 articles were included in this study, most of which were published from 2018 onwards. The most common machine learning models were random forest (6 articles, 46%), logistic regression (4 articles, 30%), support vector machines (3 articles, 23%), ensemble and hybrid learning (3 articles, 23%), and Deep Learning (3 articles, 23%). The number of sample datasets in the study varied between 85 and 14946 patients, and the models were internally validated except for two articles. The area under the curve (AUC) range for overall survival (0.40 to 0.99), disease-free survival (0.56 to 0.88), and progression-free survival (0.67 to 0.81), respectively from (lowest to highest) received. Finally, 15 variables with an effective role in predicting cervical cancer survival were identified. Conclusion Combining heterogeneous multidimensional data with machine learning techniques can play a very influential role in predicting cervical cancer survival. Despite the benefits of machine learning, the problem of interpretability, explainability, and imbalanced datasets is still one of the biggest challenges. Providing machine learning algorithms for survival prediction as a standard requires further studies.",

    "abstract_findings": "Breast cancer is the most frequently encountered medical hazard for women in their forties, affecting one in every eight women. It is the greatest cause of death worldwide, and early detection and diagnosis of the disease are extremely challenging. Breast cancer currently exceeds all other female cancers, including ovarian cancer. Researchers can use access to healthcare records to find previously unknown healthcare trends. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), breast cancer mortality rates can be lowered if the disease is detected early. The novelty of our work is to develop an optimized stacking ensemble learning (OSEL) model capable of early breast cancer prediction. A dataset from the University of California, Irvine repository was used, and comparisons to modern classifier models were undertaken. The implementation analyses reveal the unique approach’s efficacy and superiority when compared to existing contemporary categorization models (AdaBoostM1, gradient boosting, stochastic gradient boosting, CatBoost, and XGBoost). In every classification task, predictive models may be used to predict the class level, and the current research explores a range of predictive models. It is better to integrate multiple classification algorithms to generate a set of prediction models capable of predicting each class level with 91–99% accuracy. On the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, the suggested OSEL model attained a maximum accuracy of 99.45%, much higher than any single classifier. Thus, the study helps healthcare professionals find breast cancer and prevent it from happening.",

The primary hypothesis was that an ML model could achieve better accuracy in identifying low ferritin levels (<30 ng/mL) in non-anaemic patients compared with traditional methods. Design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Data were derived from secondary and tertiary care facilities within the eight-hospital Mount Sinai Health System, an urban academic health system. Participants The study included 211 486 adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with normal haemoglobin levels (≥130 g/L for men and ≥120 g/L for women) and recorded ferritin measurements. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the prediction of low ferritin levels (<30 ng/mL) using extreme gradient-boosted decision trees, an ML algorithm suited for structured clinical data. Secondary outcomes included subgroup analyses stratified by sex and age to evaluate model performance in different populations. Data from 211 486 Mount Sinai Health System patients with normal haemoglobin levels and ferritin testing were analysed. The model used demographic data, blood count indices and chemistry results to identify low ferritin levels (<30 ng/mL). Results Of the 211 486 patients analysed, 19.56% (n=41 368) of the patients had low ferritin levels. In the low ferritin group, the mean age was 41.28 years with 89.64% females. In contrast, the normal ferritin group had a mean age of 50.14 years with 62.02% females. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.814. At a sensitivity threshold of 70%, the model had a specificity of 75.85%, with a positive predictive value of 37.6% and a negative predictive value of 92.41%. The model outperformed an alternative model based only on complete blood count indices (AUC 0.814 vs 0.741). Subgroup analysis showed that model accuracy varied by sex and age, with lower performance in premenopausal women (AUC 0.736) compared with postmenopausal women (AUC 0.793) and men (AUC of 0.832 in those under 60 years and 0.806 in those aged 60 and above). Conclusions The ML model provides an effective approach to screening for IDWA using readily available EHR data. Implementing this tool in clinical settings may facilitate early diagnosis of IDWA.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background: Several studies have shown that women have a higher mortality rate than do men from ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The present study was aimed at developing a new risk-prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality in women with STEMI, using predictors that can be obtained at the time of initial evaluation. Methods: We enrolled 8158 patients who were admitted with STEMI to the Tianjin Chest Hospital and divided them into two groups according to hospital outcomes. The patient data were randomly split into a training set (75%) and a testing set (25%), and the training set was preprocessed by adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) sampling. Four commonly used machine-learning (ML) algorithms were selected for the development of models; the models were optimized by 10-fold cross-validation and grid search. The performance of all-population-derived models and female-specific models in predicting in-hospital mortality in women with STEMI was compared by several metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, G-mean, and area under the curve (AUC). Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value was applied to explain the models. Results: The performance of models was significantly improved by ADASYN. In the overall population, the support vector machine (SVM) combined with ADASYN achieved the best performance. However, it performed poorly in women with STEMI. Conversely, the proposed female-specific models performed well in women with STEMI, and the best performing model achieved 72.25% accuracy, 82.14% sensitivity, 71.69% specificity, 76.74% G-mean and 79.26% AUC. The accuracy and G-mean of the female-specific model were greater than the all-population-derived model by 34.64% and 9.07%, respectively. Conclusions: A machine-learning-based female-specific model can conveniently and effectively identify high-risk female STEMI patients who often suffer from an incorrect or delayed management.",

To overcome the issue of osteoporosis in men and women, we proposed an advanced prediction model with the help of machine learning techniques which can help to identify the potential occurrence of this bone disease by its advanced screening tools. To achieve more reliable and accurate results, various machine‐learning techniques were applied to the presented data sets. Moreover, we also compared the performance of our results with other existing algorithms to solely focus on the advanced features of the proposed methodology. The two data sets, the clinical tests of patients in Taiwan and medical reports of postmenopausal women in Korea through Korean Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2010–2011) were considered in this study. To predict bone disorders, we utilized the data about females and developed a system using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and K‐nearest neighbor. To compare the performance of the model Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and other evaluation metrics were compared. The achieved results from all the algorithms and compared them with Osteoporosis Self‐Assessment Tool for Asians and the results were noticeably better and more reliable than existing systems due to the involvement of ML. Using machine learning techniques to predict these types of diseases is better because physicians and patients can take early action to prevent the consequences in advance.",

Logistic regression and LASSO regression identified key predictors, with 10 variables selected for Model training. Eight ML algorithms were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. SHAP analysis interpreted the model’s decisions. Ten predictors were identified: age, standardized gestational weight gain, gestational weeks, severity of morning sickness, pregnancy intention, pre-pregnancy health, underlying diseases, anxiety, depression, and the combined effect of anxiety and depression. LightGBM achieved the highest AUC (0.718) in the test set, with accuracy of 0.670 and specificity of 0.764. SHAP analysis revealed depression as the strongest predictor (mean |SHAP|=0.26), followed by gestational weeks and Std. GWG. The interpretable and accurate LightGBM model, using clinically feasible variables, is a practical tool for early identification of pregnant women at high risk of sleep disorders.

Traditional methods such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) model use clinical factors. This study examined the predictive power of the FRAX score and machine-learning algorithms trained on FRAX parameters. Methods We analyzed the data of 2,147 female participants from the Ansan cohort study. The FRAX parameters employed in this study included age, sex (female), height and weight, current smoking status, excessive alcohol consumption (>3 units/d of alcohol), and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporotic fracture was defined as one or more fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist during a 10-year observation period. Machine-learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression, were employed to predict osteoporotic fractures with a 70:30 training-to-test set ratio. We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores to assess and compare the performance of these algorithms with the FRAX score. Results Of the 2,147 participants, 3.5% experienced osteoporotic fractures. Those with fractures were older, shorter in height, and had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as higher FRAX scores. The AUROC for the FRAX was 0.617. The machine-learning algorithms showed AUROC values of 0.662, 0.652, 0.648, and 0.637 for gradient boosting, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively.

    "abstract_findings": "Background Given the complexity and diversity of lichenoid vulvar disease (LVD) risk factors, it is crucial to actively explore these factors and construct personalized warning models using relevant clinical variables to assess disease risk in patients. Yet, to date, there has been insufficient research, both nationwide and internationally, on risk factors and warning models for LVD. In light of these gaps, this study represents the first systematic exploration of the risk factors associated with LVD. Objective The risk factors of LVD in women were explored and a medically evidence-based warning model was constructed to provide an early alert tool for the high-risk target population. The model can be applied in the clinic to identify high-risk patients and evaluate its accuracy and practicality in predicting LVD in women. Simultaneously, it can also enhance the diagnostic and treatment proficiency of medical personnel in primary community health service centers, which is of great significance in reducing overall health care spending and disease burden. Methods A total of 2990 patients who attended West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2013 to December 2017 were selected as the study candidates and were divided into 1218 cases in the normal vulvovagina group (group 0) and 1772 cases in the lichenoid vulvar disease group (group 1) according to the results of the case examination. We investigated and collected routine examination data from patients for intergroup comparisons, included factors with significant differences in multifactorial analysis, and constructed logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting machine (GBM), adaboost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting analysis models. The predictive efficacy of these six models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve. Results Univariate analysis revealed that vaginitis, urinary incontinence, humidity of the long-term residential environment, spicy dietary habits, regular intake of coffee or caffeinated beverages, daily sleep duration, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, presence of autoimmune diseases, menopausal status, and hypertension were all significant risk factors affecting female LVD. Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-score of the GBM warning model were notably higher than the other 5 predictive analysis models. The GBM analysis model indicated that menopausal status had the strongest impact on female LVD, showing a positive correlation, followed by the presence of autoimmune diseases, which also displayed a positive dependency. Conclusions In accordance with evidence-based medicine, the construction of a predictive warning model for female LVD can be used to identify high-risk populations at an early stage, aiding in the formulation of effective preventive measures, which is of paramount importance for reducing the incidence of LVD in women.",

Building a predictive model for PPD using data during pregnancy can facilitate earlier identification and intervention. Objective The aims of this study are to compare the effects of four different machine learning models using data during pregnancy to predict PPD and explore which factors in the model are the most important for PPD prediction. Methods Information on the pregnancy period from a cohort of 508 women, including demographics, social environmental factors, and mental health, was used as predictors in the models. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score within 42 days after delivery was used as the outcome indicator. Using two feature selection methods (expert consultation and random forest-based filter feature selection [FFS-RF]) and two algorithms (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]), we developed four different machine learning PPD prediction models and compared their prediction effects. Results There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two feature selection methods in terms of model prediction performance, but 10 fewer factors were selected with the FFS-RF than with the expert consultation method. The model based on SVM and FFS-RF had the best prediction effects (sensitivity=0.69, area under the curve=0.78). In the feature importance ranking output by the RF algorithm, psychological elasticity, depression during the third trimester, and income level were the most important predictors. Conclusions In contrast to the expert consultation method, FFS-RF was important in dimension reduction. When the sample size is small, the SVM algorithm is suitable for predicting PPD. In the prevention of PPD, more attention should be paid to the psychological resilience of mothers.",

This study focused on predicting suicidal thoughts using machine learning, leveraging the 2021 National Women's Life Experience Survey (SPHPN) involving women aged 15 to 64. Analyzing 11,305 ever-married women, 504 (4.5%) reported experiencing suicidal thoughts. The outcome variable was binary (1 for suicidal thoughts, 0 for none). The study used seven predictors: age, education level, residence type, physical and sexual violence, smoking frequency, alcohol consumption, and depression. Ordinary logistic regression and SMOTE-based logistic regression were applied. The former identified physical violence, depression, and sexual violence as crucial factors, while the latter emphasized physical violence, sexual violence, and age. In cases of class imbalance, the SMOTE-enhanced model exhibited improved performance in terms of sensitivity, false positive rate, balanced accuracy, and Kappa statistic, with lower standard errors of parameter estimates. The findings highlight the importance of addressing violence and mental health in policies aimed at reducing suicidal thoughts among women. Policymakers can use these insights to develop targeted interventions, and healthcare providers can identify high-risk individuals for timely interventions. Community programs and public health campaigns should promote mental well-being and prevent suicidal behaviors using these findings. Future research should include more predictors, diverse populations, and longitudinal data to better understand causal relationships and timing. Interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced machine learning techniques can enhance predictive accuracy and model interpretability.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background: Menstrual literacy is crucial for safeguarding the health, dignity, and rights of women. However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Bangladesh, it remains an overlooked issue. Female university students, positioned at a pivotal developmental stage, require accurate and comprehensive knowledge about menstruation. Despite overall improvements in education, significant gaps persist in menstrual knowledge and hygiene practices among this group. Objectives: This study aimed to predict menstrual literacy levels among female university students in Bangladesh using tree-based machine learning models. It also sought to identify the most influential predictors shaping menstrual knowledge. Design: A cross-sectional analytical design was employed to assess menstrual literacy and apply predictive modeling. Methods: A total of 576 female students from a public university in Bangladesh participated in a structured survey. Data were collected on sociodemographic and menstrual characteristics. Five tree-based machine learning models—Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, LightGBM, and XGBoost—were trained to classify participants based on their level of menstrual knowledge. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)- Area Under the Curve metrics. Results: Overall, 76% of participants demonstrated good menstrual knowledge, while 24% had poor knowledge. The Random Forest model outperformed others with an accuracy of 81%, followed closely by Extra Trees, LightGBM, and XGBoost (each at 80%). Key predictors identified across models included menstrual duration, type of hygiene materials used, permanent residence, and whether participants received early menstrual education. All models performed better in predicting participants with good knowledge, revealing a class imbalance. Conclusion: Tree-based machine learning approaches effectively predict menstrual literacy and uncover critical influencing factors. These findings can guide targeted educational interventions and public health strategies to improve menstrual literacy, particularly in LMIC settings such as Bangladesh.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background: Population aging is emerging as an increasingly acute challenge for countries around the world. One particular manifestation of this phenomenon is the impact of osteoporosis on individuals and national health systems. Previous studies of risk factors for osteoporosis were conducted using traditional statistical methods, but more recent efforts have turned to machine learning approaches. Most such efforts, however, treat the target variable (bone mineral density [BMD] or fracture rate) as a categorical one, which provides no quantitative information. The present study uses five different machine learning methods to analyze the risk factors for T-score of BMD, seeking to (1) compare the prediction accuracy between different machine learning methods and traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) and (2) rank the importance of 25 different risk factors. Methods: The study sample includes 24 412 women older than 55 years with 25 related variables, applying traditional MLR and five different machine learning methods: classification and regression tree, Naïve Bayes, random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, and eXtreme gradient boosting. The metrics used for model performance comparisons are the symmetric mean absolute percentage error, relative absolute error, root relative squared error, and root mean squared error. Results: Machine learning approaches outperformed MLR for all four prediction errors. The average importance ranking of each factor generated by the machine learning methods indicates that age is the most important factor determining T-score, followed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index (BMI), uric acid (UA), and education level. Conclusion: In a group of women older than 55 years, we demonstrated that machine learning methods provide superior performance in estimating T-Score, with age being the most important impact factor, followed by eGFR, BMI, UA, and education level.",

Black and Latina women have higher rates of PND, yet they are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been effective in predicting postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, which contributed to biases in ML models for minority women. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could serve to predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a hospital in a large urban city that mostly served low-income Black and Hispanic women (N=5,875) in the U.S. Depressive symptom severity was assessed from a self-reported questionnaire, PHQ-9. We investigated multiple ML classifiers, used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for model interpretation, and determined model prediction bias with two metrics, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity Difference. While ML model (Elastic Net) performance was low (ROCAUC=0.67), we identified well-known factors associated with PND, such as unplanned pregnancy and being single, as well as underexplored factors, such as self-report pain levels, lower levels of prenatal vitamin supplement intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels blood. Our findings showed that despite being based on a sample mostly composed of 75% low-income minority women (54% Black and 27% Latina), the model performance was lower for these communities. In conclusion, ML models based on EMRs could moderately predict depression",

Cancer types can be distinguished into two types: benign and malignant. this research aims to provide information and science to medical professionals and also cancer patients to know the classification of the two types of cancer. The research project aims to also leverage data mining techniques using several algorithms on Machine Learning (ML) such as Decision Tree(DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Tress (XGBoost). The results of this algorithm will determine the prediction of the most common types of cancer. The study used 683 samples of breast cancer patients, including 10 characteristics. This test is measured through mammography and biopsy tests. Using K-Fold Validation operators, then the sresults of the study showed that the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm produced the highest accuracy of 96.87% compared to the other five algorithms. Then, as a comparison again, the researchers also optimized the accuracy value using the parameter optimize operator. Where the number produced becomes more overwhelming.

High blood pressure, abnormal glucose levels, depression, anxiety, and other maternal health conditions can all lead to pregnancy complications. Proper identification and monitoring of risk factors can assist to reduce pregnancy complications. The primary goal of this research is to use real-world datasets to identify and predict Maternal Health Risk (MHR) factors. As a result, we developed and implemented the Quad-Ensemble Machine Learning framework to predict Maternal Health Risk Classification (QEML-MHRC). The methodology used a vacxsriety of Machine Learning (ML) models, which then integrated with four ensemble ML techniques to improve prediction. The dataset collected from various maternity hospitals and clinics subjected to nineteen training and testing tests. According to the exploratory data analysis, the most significant risk factors for pregnant women include high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and high blood sugar levels. The study proposed a novel approach to dealing with high-risk factors linked to maternal health. Dealing with class-specific performance elaborated further to properly understand the distinction between high, low, and medium risks. All tests yielded outstanding results when predicting the amount of risk during pregnancy. In terms of class performance, the dataset associated with the “HR” class outperformed the others, predicting 90% correctly. GBT with ensemble stacking outperformed and demonstrated remarkable performance for all evaluation measure (0.86) across all classes in the dataset. The key success of the models used in this work is the ability to measure model performance using a class-wise distribution. The proposed approach can help medical experts assess maternal health risks, saving lives and preventing complications throughout pregnancy. The prediction approach presented in this study can detect high-risk pregnancies early on, allowing for timely intervention and treatment. This study’s development and findings have the potential to raise public awareness of maternal health issues.",

Although traditional diagnostic techniques function well they require extended time along with high costs and show limitations in human error rates. The project establishes an automatic breast cancer detection system through machine learning algorithms whereDecision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) function as supervised learning engines. This system applies the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset that contains 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of breast masses from FNA samples to reach its evaluation. The features consist of radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness together with concavity measurements that describe the cell nuclei characteristics. The development process includes data normalization along with scaling and separates data into training and testing portions for model implementation and evaluation. The model includes two classifiers: The Decision Tree as an understandable solution and SVM which excels at processing complex features. The evaluation metrics for both classifiers include standard measures that encompass accuracy together with precision and recall and F1-score. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been integrated to make machine learning models more transparent because medical professionals require such methods to reinforce trust. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretive method shows global feature importance as well as local prediction importance so doctors can fully understand feature effects on model outputs.

This study aims to bridge the gap between traditional statistical methods and machine learning in survival analysis by revealing which techniques are most effective in predicting survival, with a particular emphasis on improving prediction accuracy and identifying key risk factors for cervical cancer. Women with cervical cancer diagnosed between 2013 and 2015 were included in our study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Using this dataset, the study assesses the performance of Weibull, Cox proportional hazards models, and Random Survival Forests in terms of predictive accuracy and risk factor identification. The findings reveal that machine learning models, particularly Random Survival Forests (RSF), outperform traditional statistical methods in both predictive accuracy and the discernment of crucial prognostic factors, underscoring the advantages of machine learning in handling complex survival data. However, for a survival dataset with a small number of predictors, statistical models should be used first. The study finds that RSF models enhance survival analysis with more accurate predictions and insights into survival risk factors but highlights the need for larger datasets and further research on model interpretability and clinical applicability.",

There is a need for accurate, non-invasive diagnostics, particularly through gender-specific biomarker research in female RNA-Seq data. To address this disparity, RNA-Seq data was analyzed using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to categorize female-specific MDD, identifying 10 critical biomarkers and utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics to extract transcriptome data from publicly available datasets, while employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation due to the limited availability of large RNA-Seq datasets. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and other bioinformatics analyses further demonstrated that genes differentially expressed in MDD patients were enriched in pathways related to the cell cycle, neutrophil degranulation, resolution of sister chromatid cohesion, and the formation of mitotic spindles by EML4 and NUDC. Ten important biomarkers associated with MDD were identified by an integrative bioinformatics investigation: IGHV3-64D, IGHV5-10-1, IFI27, LILRB5, PBK, SIGLEC1, IFI44L, CDCA5, and SLC4A1.

    "abstract_findings": "Increased heart dose during postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for left-sided breast cancer (BC) can cause cardiac injury, which can decrease patient survival. The deep inspiration breath-hold technique (DIBH) is becoming increasingly common for reducing the mean heart dose (MHD) in patients with left-sided BC. However, treatment planning and DIBH for RT are laborious, time-consuming and costly for patients and RT staff. In addition, the proportion of patients with left BC with low MHD is considerably higher among Asian women, mainly due to their smaller breast volume compared with that in Western countries. The present study aimed to determine the optimal machine learning (ML) model for predicting the MHD after RT to pre-select patients with low MHD who will not require DIBH prior to RT planning. In total, 562 patients with BC who received postoperative RT were randomly divided into the trainval (n=449) and external (n=113) test datasets for ML using Python (version 3.8). Imbalanced data were corrected using synthetic minority oversampling with Gaussian noise. Specifically, right-left, tumor site, chest wall thickness, irradiation method, body mass index and separation were the six explanatory variables used for ML, with four supervised ML algorithms used. Using the optimal value of hyperparameter tuning with root mean squared error (RMSE) as an indicator for the internal test data, the model yielding the best F2 score evaluation was selected for final validation using the external test data. The predictive ability of MHD for true MHD after RT was the highest among all algorithms for the deep neural network, with a RMSE of 77.4, F2 score of 0.80 and area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic of 0.88, for a cut-off value of 300 cGy. The present study suggested that ML can be used to pre-select female Asian patients with low MHD who do not require DIBH for the postoperative RT of BC.",

The need to develop a quick, cheap and efficient method to diagnose a precursor lesion in an environment with high burden of the diseases with a view of reducing the burden of the disease motivated the need to apply Machine Learning (ML) technique towards cancer prediction. The primary objective of the study was to develop a ML model that can predict the occurrence of cervical cancer with a higher degree of accuracy. The cervical cancer dataset used in this study was obtained from Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) and Aids Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN). Several ML techniques were considered which includes Ensemble Bagged Tree, Fine Gaussian SVM, Cubic SVM, Fine Tree, Quadratic SVM, Medium Gaussian SVM, Ensemble Boosted Tree, Ensemble Rusboosted Tree, Medium Tree, Linear SVM, Corase Gaussian SVM and Coarse Tree algorithm. The study shows that Ensemble Bagged Tree and Fine Gaussian SVM gives a higher cervical cancer predictive accuracy of 99.7 percent and 99.6 percent respectively as the best performing predictive models, followed by Cubic SVM and Fine Tree with 98 percent and Fine Tree with 96.6 percent cervical cancer predictive accuracy respectively.

Methods: A structured questionnaire-based online survey was conducted on 2121 university students (private and public) living in Bangladesh. After obtaining informed consent, the participants completed a web-based survey examining sociodemographic variables and behavioral tests (including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 scale). This study applied six well-known ML algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis, K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and which were used to predict mental illness among university students from Dhaka city in Bangladesh. Results: Of the 2121 eligible respondents, 45% were male and 55% were female, and approximately 76.9% were 21–25 years old. The prevalence of severe depression and severe anxiety was higher for women than for men. Based on various performance parameters, the results of the accuracy assessment showed that RF outperformed other models for the prediction of depression (89% accuracy), while SVM provided the best result than other models for the prediction of anxiety (91.49% accuracy). Conclusion: Based on these findings, we recommend that the RF algorithm and the SVM algorithm were more moderate than any other ML algorithm used in this study to predict the mental health status of university students in Bangladesh (depression and anxiety, respectively). Finally, this study proposes to apply RF and SVM classification when the prediction of mental illness status is the core interest.",

PCOS is a hormonal disorder that leads to delayed, irregular, or absent menstrual cycles in the female body. This syndrome may cause the growth of type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, weight gain, excess body hair, and many other complications. In advanced cases, PCOS may lead to infertility, which is a challenge for patients who are attempting to conceive. According to statistics, the rate of incidence of PCOS in recent years has greatly increased, which is alarming. If PCOS is diagnosed early enough, individuals can adhere to their physician's advice and live a healthier life. The data collection in this study includes records of 466 patients. The purpose of this study is to utilize machine learning models to determine patterns in this disorder. The learned information is then fed into different algorithms to determine accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision using different ML models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) among others. The study used the Mutual Information model for feature selection and compared models to identify the most precise one.

We aim to utilize machine learning for predicting risk of postpartum depression (PPD) using primary care electronic health records (EHR) data, and to evaluate the potential value of EHR-based prediction in improving the accuracy of PPD screening and in early identification of women at risk. Methods We analyzed EHR data of 266,544 women from the UK who gave first live birth between 2000 and 2017. We extracted a multitude of socio-demographic and medical variables and constructed a machine learning model that predicts the risk of PPD during the year following childbirth. We evaluated the model’s performance using multiple validation methodologies and measured its accuracy as a stand-alone tool and as an adjunct to the standard questionnaire-based screening by Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). Results The prevalence of PPD in the analyzed cohort was 13.4%. Combing EHR-based prediction with EPDS score increased the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) from 0.805 to 0.844 and the sensitivity from 0.72 to 0.76, at specificity of 0.80. The AUC of the EHR-based prediction model alone varied from 0.72 to 0.74 and decreased by only 0.01–0.02 when applied as early as before the beginning of pregnancy. Conclusions PPD risk prediction using EHR data may provide a complementary quantitative and objective tool for PPD screening, allowing earlier (pre-pregnancy) and more accurate identification of women at risk, timely interventions and potentially improved outcomes for the mother and child.",

    "abstract_findings": "The prevalence of depression symptoms, the third most disabling disease worldwide, is as high as 11.5%-21.1% in China’s middle-aged and elderly population and increases significantly with age. It is crucial to identify high-risk groups efficiently and implement appropriate early interventions to improve the performance of depression risk prediction models. We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011–2020) to track depression the onset characteristics of depression symptoms in adults aged over 45 without depressive symptoms at baseline. This tracking was conducted over 9 years, involving four follow-ups. Eight machine-learning models, with pre-sampling and three types of resampled data, were employed. Their hyperparameters were optimized through a grid search strategy and tenfold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated, including the area under the ROC curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, Shapley Additive Properties (SHAP) plots for interpretability. The cumulative incidence of depression symptoms at different follow-up time points was 19.043%, 22.554%, 27.416%, and 29.416%, respectively, with higher incidence rates in females, rural areas, those with low education, and the western regions. The RandomUnder-Sampler-extreme gradient boosting(XGB) model performed optimally in predicting the 9-year risk of depression symptoms (recall = 70.36%, F1 = 0.5605, AUC = 0.750). SHAP analysis showed that education level, cognitive ability, and satisfaction with life were the core factors affecting the prediction of depression symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in China’s middle-aged and elderly population is high, and the influencing factors are complex. When predicting depressive symptoms, the model should be selected based on the prediction needs, and random undersampling with XGB is suitable for long-term risk prediction in large-scale populations. For high-risk groups, accurate prediction strategies can be used to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.",

    "abstract_findings": "Introduction Intravesical onabotulinumA injection is actively used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). However, it occasionally results in significant post-void residual urine (PVR) volume, which can lead to complications and can further impair the activities of daily living in older people. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of a high post-onabotulinumA injection PVR volume in older women with severe OAB. Methods An observational study was conducted on older women who had previously received intravesical onabotulinumA injections to treat OAB between 2020 and 2022. Urodynamic studies and symptom assessments were conducted, and machine learning models, including random forest and support vector machine (SVM) models, were developed using the R code generated by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT, OpenAI, San Francisco, USA). Results Among 128 patients with OAB, 23 (18.0%) had a PVR volume of > 200 mL after receiving onabotulinumA injections. The factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Age, frailty, OAB-wet, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significant predictors. Random forest analysis highlighted daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency as important factors. An SVM model incorporating daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding efficiency improved PVR volume prediction. Logit(p) estimation yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926294. Conclusion The study found daytime frequency, frailty, and voiding inefficiency to be significant factors associated with a PVR volume of > 200 mL, in older women with severe OAB. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and following the guidance of ChatGPT, this research emphasizes the relevance of considering multiple intersecting factors for predicting PVR volume. The findings contribute to our understanding of onabotulinumA injection treatment for OAB and support evidence-based decision-making using readily available information.",

    "abstract_findings": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal dilation of the abdominal aorta that carries up to a 90% mortality rate when ruptured. Although male patients experience AAA at a higher rate than females, female patients experience AAA rupture at a rate three- to four-fold higher that of their male counterparts. The current standard clinicians use for determining when to surgically intervene is maximum transverse diameter of the AAA perpendicular to the axis of flow. However, some aneurysms below these diameter thresholds rupture. Machine learning (ML) classification models have been previously shown to predict patient outcomes with more discriminability than the diameter criterion. However, these models do not consider sex-based differences. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigate how creating sex-specific ML models impacts patient outcome prediction as compared to a general model encompassing all patients (sex agnostic). Computed tomography image sets were acquired from 537 patients (n = 159 female, n = 378 male) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Mayo Clinic Health Systems. Features used as input to the ML models were categorized as clinical, biomechanical, and morphological data. Prior to ML model training, patient data were randomly split for 20% holdout testing. ML models encompassing all patients (general model), only male patients (male-specific model), and only female patients (female-specific model) were trained and tested. A female-specific model and male-specific model both had a higher maximum area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values than a general model for female patients and male patients, respectively. Equalizing the sample sizes of female and male patients in the model led to improved outcomes for female patients without decreasing performance for male patients. ML classification models show promise in improving predictions of patient outcomes for AAA. The higher AAA prevalence rate for males leads to female patients being underrepresented in AAA datasets. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that sex-specific models outperformed a general model in predicting patient outcomes. Additionally, equalizing sample sizes within the dataset improved predictions for female patients without compromising overall performance of the model. As ML applications in medicine continue to grow, it is important to consider population representation within datasets to reduce model bias. Although abdominal aortic aneurysm has a higher prevalence rate in male patients, female patients experience higher rupture rates as well as higher surgical and post-operative mortality rates, indicating a need for sex-based considerations in outcome prediction. This work demonstrates improved outcome predictions when patient models are striated based on sex for female and male patients as well as sex-specific differences in feature importance, suggesting that grouping by sex should be considered in ML models for AAA outcome prediction. As machine learning tools continue to grow in prevalence within the medical environment, accounting for bias within these models is crucial to ensure generalizability.

As machine learning tools continue to grow in prevalence within the medical environment, accounting for bias within these models is crucial to ensure generalizability. Ballooning of the aorta, a major artery that delivers blood from the heart to the body, in the abdomen, or an abdominal aortic aneurysm, is often asymptomatic, but can be deadly if ruptured. However, not all abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture. Predicting if rupture will occur is important, as surgery can prevent rupture, but also comes with its own risks. Clinicians currently use the diameter of the aneurysm to decide when to perform surgery, but diameter does not always accurately predict ruptures. Men get abdominal aortic aneurysms more than women do, but women have a higher rate of these ruptures. There have been some machine learning tools that have been designed to predict when these ruptures occur, but they do not account for differences between men and women in their models. In this work, tools were created that did a better job of predicting whether or not an aneurysm will rupture than diameter. The tools that were sex-specific did a better job than the ones that encompassed all patients.",

Existing models often focus on isolated treatment stages and rely on linear statistical assumptions, limiting their ability to support personalized care throughout the entire treatment process. Methods This retrospective study included 1,062 women who underwent IVF/ICSI between 2016 and 2021, with an additional temporal validation cohort of 250 patients treated in 2022. Two machine learning (ML) models were developed to predict clinical pregnancy outcomes during the pre-treatment and treatment phases. Model performance was evaluated using metrics including precision-recall curves, F1 score, calibration, Brier score, and decision curve analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to enhance interpretability, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis explored nonlinear relationships. Both models were deployed as interactive web calculators to facilitate clinical use. Results Both models demonstrated favorable performance in internal and external validation. Key predictors identified for the pre-treatment phase included female age, antral follicle count (AFC), and body mass index (BMI). For the treatment phase, important predictors comprised serum progesterone level on HCG day, gonadotropin dosage, and endometrial thickness on HCG day. RCS and subgroup analyses revealed significant nonlinear threshold effects of these variables on pregnancy probability. Conclusion We developed and validated dual-phase ML models for clinical pregnancy prediction across IVF/ICSI stages. Through improved interpretability and online accessibility, our models offer a practical and individualized decision-support tool to optimize ART strategies in real-world clinical settings.

In this paper, we studied various machine learning models and CNN to find out which model is compatible with medical images to classify them and provide better outcomes. This paper used LR, NB, KNN, Support vector machine, GB, Xtreme gradient boosting, and CNN methods to classify images for malignant and benign images. As for future work, we can study various advanced ensemble learning and deep learning approaches. So that we can predict various types of sensitive medical data more accurately.",

    "abstract_findings": "Paying attention to the mental health of perinatal women is helpful in improving their quality of life. However, the existing research pays less attention to the heterogeneity of its negative emotional trajectory and the identification of high‐risk groups. This study recruited 860 perinatal women from four large hospitals in Chongqing from March 2018 to January 2019. They were followed up by structured questionnaires in the first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, and about 6 weeks after delivery. The growth mixture model was used to analyze the developmental trajectory of negative emotions, and six machine learning algorithms were used to establish a high‐risk negative emotion recognition model. The performance of the model was comprehensively evaluated by five performance indicators. The SHAP algorithm was used to explain the model. Negative emotional trajectories were divided into four categories: low‐stable anxiety group, gradually increasing high‐anxiety group, mild sustained depression group, and high‐progressive depression group. The extreme gradient boosting model performed best, with the highest prediction performance score (24 points). In summary, the negative emotional trajectory of perinatal women is dynamic and heterogeneous, and the prediction model based on machine learning may play an important role in identifying high‐risk negative emotions.",

    "abstract_findings": "Human mental health (HMH) is a pervasive and impactful condition that profoundly affects an individual’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioural aspects in a negative manner. Among various mental health disorders, depression is particularly prevalent, with approximately 20% of women experiencing at least one depressive episode during their lifetime. Identifying depression early on is crucial for timely intervention and support. This study examines user-generated content from major social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, aiming to detect potential signs of depression through behavioural symptoms such as mood changes, loss of interest, altered sleep patterns, focus difficulties, and impaired decision-making. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, sentiment analysis deciphers emotional context in posts and comments. A new efficient methodology utilizing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed for efficient analysis of the posts and comments. Knowledge distillation transfers insights from a large BERT model to a smaller one, enhancing accuracy. Integrating word2vec and BERT with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), the approach effectively analyses depression and anxiety indicators in social media data. Comparative assessments highlight the system’s excellence, achieving a remarkable 98.5% accuracy through knowledge distillation. The proposed methodology marks a substantial stride in identifying mental health signals from social media, facilitating better early intervention and support for those facing depression and anxiety-related challenges.",

Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard for assessing Appendicular Lean Mass Index (ALMI), it is costly and often inaccessible. This study aims to develop machine learning models using anthropometric measurements to predict low ALMI for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 183 Mexican adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men, ≥60 years old). ALMI was measured using DXA, and anthropometric data were collected following the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) protocols. Predictive models were developed using Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forests (RFs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and LASSO regression. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Model performance was evaluated using classification performance metrics and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: ALMI indicated strong correlations with BMI, corrected calf girth, and arm relaxed girth. Among models, DT achieved the best performance in females (AUC = 0.84), and ANN indicated the highest AUC in males (0.92). Regarding the prediction of low ALMI, specificity values were highest in DT for females (100%), while RF performed best in males (92%). The key predictive variables varied depending on sex, with BMI and calf girth being the most relevant for females and arm girth for males. Conclusions: Anthropometry combined with machine learning provides an accurate, low-cost approach for identifying low ALMI in older adults. This method could facilitate sarcopenia screening in clinical settings with limited access to advanced diagnostic tools.",

In this last case, out of the total of female victims that fill a complaint against their abuser and initiate the legal proceedings, a significant number withdraw from it for different reasons. In this field, it is interesting to detect the victims that disengage from the legal process so that professionals can intervene before it occurs. Previous studies have applied statistical models to use input variables and make a prediction of withdrawal. However, it has not been found in the literature any study that uses machine learning models to predict disengagement from the legal proceedings in IPV cases, which can be a better option to detect these events with a higher precision. Therefore, in this work, a novel application of machine learning techniques to predict the decision of victims of IPV to withdraw from prosecution is studied. For this purpose, three different ML algorithms have been optimized and tested with the original dataset to prove the great performance of ML models against non-linear input data. Once the best models have been obtained, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques have been applied to search for the most informative input features and reduce the original dataset to the most important variables. Finally, these results have been compared to those obtained in the previous work that used statistical techniques, and the set of most informative parameters has been combined with the variables of the previous study, showing that ML-based models have a better predictive accuracy in all cases and that by adding one new variable to the previous work' subset, the accuracy to detect withdrawal improves by 7.5%.",

Methods We predicted clinical outcomes for 307 patients (151 females, 156 males; 68 ± 14 years) from the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin study using 43 baseline features. Outcomes included modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index (BI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and survival. The ML models included a Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel and a radial basis function kernel as well as a Gradient Boosting Classifier based on repeated 5-fold nested cross-validation. The leading prognostic features were identified using Shapley additive explanations. Results The ML models achieved significant prediction performance for mRS at patient discharge and after 1 year, BI and MMSE at patient discharge, TICS-M after 1 and 3 years and CES-D after 1 year. Additionally, we showed that National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was the top predictor for most functional recovery outcomes as well as education for cognitive function and depression.

Methods: In a cluster-sample community survey of 9,387 elderly people in 5 subdistricts of Wuxi City, data on sociodemographics and neuropsychological self-rating scales for depression, anxiety, and cognition evaluation were collected. Machine learning models were developed to predict their dementia risk and identify risk factors.

Building a predictive model for PPD using data during pregnancy can facilitate earlier identification and intervention. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study are to compare the effects of four different machine learning models using data during pregnancy to predict PPD and explore which factors in the model are the most important for PPD prediction. METHODS Information on the pregnancy period from a cohort of 508 women, including demographics, social environmental factors, and mental health, was used as predictors in the models. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score within 42 days after delivery was used as the outcome indicator. Using two feature selection methods (expert consultation and random forest-based filter feature selection [FFS-RF]) and two algorithms (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]), we developed four different machine learning PPD prediction models and compared their prediction effects. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two feature selection methods in terms of model prediction performance, but 10 fewer factors were selected with the FFS-RF than with the expert consultation method. The model based on SVM and FFS-RF had the best prediction effects (sensitivity=0.69, area under the curve=0.78). In the feature importance ranking output by the RF algorithm, psychological elasticity, depression during the third trimester, and income level were the most important predictors. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the expert consultation method, FFS-RF was important in dimension reduction. When the sample size is small, the SVM algorithm is suitable for predicting PPD. In the prevention of PPD, more attention should be paid to the psychological resilience of mothers.",

Following an extensive review of the available literature, we have identified a range of recently studied risk factors associated with breast cancer. Subsequently, we gathered data on these factors and breast cancer incidence rates from numerous online sources encompassing 151 countries. To evaluate the relationship between these factors and breast cancer incidence, we assessed the normality of the data and conducted Spearman’s correlation test. Furthermore, we refined six regression models to forecast future breast cancer incidence rates. Our findings indicate that the incidence of breast cancer is most positively correlated with the average age of women in a country, as well as factors such as meat consumption, CO2 emissions, depression, sugar consumption, tobacco use, milk intake, mobile cells, alcohol consumption, pesticides, and oral contraceptive use. As for prediction, the CatBoost Regressor successfully predicted future breast cancer incidence with an R squared value of 0.84 ± 0.03. An increased incidence of breast cancer is mainly associated with dietary habits and lifestyle.

This condition weakens the bones and increases the risk of fractures. Women who have gone through menopause are more susceptible to osteoporosis due to hormonal changes. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the condition early to start preventive treatments and reduce the risk of fractures. To address the challenges of diagnosing low BMD in postmenopausal women in community settings, this study proposes a method that combines machine learning with the AdaBoostM1 algorithm, which has shown promising results. Data acquisition, data preprocessing, data training, model testing, and model prediction and evaluation are integral phases of the operational dynamics of our model in osteoporosis diagnosis. This approach recommends increasing screening initiatives and educating patients as strategies to improve early detection and management of the disease. The analysis method used achieved an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 88.8% on the dataset it was applied to. The area under the curve was 0.87, the true positive rate was 88%, and the F1 measure was 0.88. By using accurate diagnostic techniques and providing proactive community care, the incidence of osteoporotic fractures can be significantly reduced, thus improving the quality of life for this vulnerable population.",

Although several studies have exmanined mental health among Bangladeshi students, few have integrated conventional statistical analyses with advanced machine learning (ML) approaches. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladeshi university students, and to evaluate the predictive performance of multiple ML models for those outcomes. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2024 among 1697 students residing in halls at two public universities in Bangladesh: Jahangirnagar University and Patuakhali Science and Technology University. Data on sociodemographic, health, and behavioral factors were collected via structured questionnaires. Mental health outcomes were measured using the validated Bangla version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and binary logistic regression, while seven ML models including, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed to predict mental health outcomes. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 56.9%, 69.5%, and 32.2%, respectively. Significant associated factors for depression included unfriendly family relationships, enrollment in commerce, and cigarette smoking. Female gender, unfriendly family relationships, academic year, and cigarette smoking were significant factors for stress. No significant factors were identified for anxiety. Among ML models, SVM achieved the highest accuracy for depression prediction (accuracy = 0.5693; precision = 0.7560; log loss = 0.6847), LR for anxiety (accuracy = 0.6948; precision = 0.7881), and CatBoost for stress (accuracy = 0.6706; precision = 0.6454; F1-score = 0.5777; log loss = 0.6284). Feature importance analyses highlighted faculty of study and relation with family as the top predictors. ROC-AUC values indicated moderate discriminatory performance (all ≥ 0.5). Integrating machine learning with conventional analyses enhances the identification and prediction of factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among university students. These findings support the implementation of campus-based mental health screening, accessible counseling, and peer support programs, and highlight the value of data-driven approaches for developing targeted university mental health policies.",

The physical and mental effects of pregnancy and childbirth, like those of many other fleeting life experiences, have the significant potential to influence a mother’s overall health and well-being. They have also been known to trigger Postpartum Depression (PPD) in many cases. PPD can be exhausting for the mother and it may have a negative impact on her capacity to care for herself and her kid if it is not treated. For this reason, in this study, initially, physiological questionnaire Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) data were collected from delivered mothers for one week, the score was evaluated by medical experts, and participants with PDD symptoms were identified. As a part of multistage progress, further, follow-up was carried out by collecting the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) questionnaires for the above-predicted participants until six weeks. As the second step, correlated risk factors with PPD symptoms were identified using statistical analysis. Finally, data were analyzed and used to train and test machine learning algorithms in order to predict postpartum depression from one to six weeks. The extremely Randomized Trees (XRT) algorithm with (Background Information + PHQ-9 + PDSS) data offers the most accurate and efficient prediction. Pregnant women with these features could be identified and treated properly. Moreover, it reduces prolonged complications and remains cost-effective in future clinical models.",

The objective of this study is to determine the key determinants of depression among ever-married women in Bangladesh. This study used 19,987 ever-married women aged 15-49 years in Bangladesh, from the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). The key features selection was selected by using Boruta algorithm. Total seven machine learning approaches, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbour’s (KNN), and Neural Network (NN) were evaluated for predictive performance. All models were highly tuned with 5-fold cross-validation and tested on several complementary predictions including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). The top-performing algorithm was observed XGBoost approach with the highest AUROC of 0.799, indicating strong discriminatory power between non-depressed and depressed women. Results from XGBoost approach revealed that anxiety, currently working, age group 45-49 years, internet user, menstruated last 6 weeks, pressure to pregnant, power of decision making etc. are most important determinants of the depression of married women in Bangladesh.

    "abstract_findings": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any uncontrolled urine leakage. Pelvic floor muscles (PFM) appear to be a crucial aspect of trunk and lumbo-pelvic stability, and UI is one indication of pelvic floor dysfunction. The evaluation of pelvic tilt and lumbar angle is critical in assessing the alignment and posture of the spine in the lower back region and pelvis, and both of these variables are directly related to female dysfunction in the pelvic floor. UI affects a significant number of women worldwide and can have a major impact on their quality of life. However, traditional methods of assessing these parameters involve manual measurements, which are time-consuming and prone to variability. The rehabilitation programs for pelvic floor dysfunction (FSD) in physical therapy often focus on pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), while other core muscles are overlooked. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the activity of various core muscles in multiparous women with FSD using multiple scales instead of relying on Ultrasound imaging. Decision tree, SVM, random forest, and AdaBoost models were applied to predict pelvic tilt and lumbar angle using the train set. Performance was evaluated on the test set using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R^2. Pelvic tilt prediction achieved R^2 values > 0.9, with AdaBoost (R^2 = 0.944) performing best. Lumbar angle prediction performed slightly lower with decision tree achieving the highest R^2 of 0.976. Developing a machine learning model to predict pelvic tilt and lumbar angle has the potential to revolutionize the assessment and management of this condition, providing faster, more accurate, and more objective assessments than traditional methods.",

In this study, Machine learning-based data mining techniques were utilized to construct a reliable prediction model for clinical pregnancy in IVF. Study Design: A retrospective cohort multicenter study involving 4.570 IVF cycles. All patients underwent fresh embryo transfer at either the cleavage or blastocyst stage between January 2015 and December 2019. The experiment focused on utilizing tree-based classifiers to generate and compare the most effective prediction model that could predict a clinical pregnancy through clinical data. Additionally, each classifier is optimized via a genetic algorithm technique, along with the selection of variables. Results: Both the decision tree and random forest showed similar performance that was much better than the gradient boost. The two superior classifiers achieved a balanced accuracy of roughly 0.62. Additionally, each prediction model was shown to work optimally with different combinations of variables, with some variables being consistently included, such as female age, and some consistently excluded, which provides an insight into the relationship between the variables and each prediction model. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithm remains effective for the purpose of data mining and knowledge extraction in IVF clinical datasets through which a relatively reliable prediction system for clinical pregnancy could be constructed, provided the available data is sufficient.",

Utilizing data from 7,169 middle school students (aged 14.98 ± 1.58 years, depression prevalence 36.01%) in Liaoning Province, China, 21 key predictors were selected via LASSO regression and Boruta algorithm. Five models (XGBoost, random forest, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine) were evaluated. XGBoost demonstrated optimal performance (AUC = 0.912). SHAP analysis identified five core predictors: sleep quality (primary factor), authenticity, meaning in life, sense of control, and perceived peer-related stress. Protective factors included sleep quality, authenticity, and sense of control, while perceived peer-related stress was a risk factor. Nonlinear associations emerged between meaning in life and depression, with age-stratified thresholds (12–13 years: moderate meaning linked to highest risk; 14–16 years: moderate meaning reduced risk; 17–18 years: high meaning mitigated risk). Findings suggest a tri-level intervention framework: sleep-exercise programs (biological), age-specific resilience training (cognitive), and AI-driven school stress monitoring (environmental).</p>",

While timely identification and effective intervention are crucial for addressing this issue, existing research often falls short in providing a systematic analysis of the various influencing factors. This study utilizes the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset to thoroughly explore the multiple factors that contribute to depression in older adults. During the data preprocessing phase, we meticulously ensured data quality by analyzing the relationships between variables through correlation coefficient heatmaps and conducting chi-square tests to assess independence. Following this, we constructed and optimized several predictive models, including random forests, decision trees, and naive Bayes, fine-tuning their parameters for enhanced performance. Ultimately, the experimental results demonstrated that the optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model excelled in predicting depression in the elderly, providing robust theoretical support and empirical evidence that can inform targeted strategies for improving the mental health and overall well-being of older adults.</jats:p>",

The Delong test showed that there was a significant difference between the ROC curves of XGBoost and the other models (&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;P&amp;lt;/I&amp;gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The global interpretation based on SHAP showed that life satisfaction, self-rated health status, sleep duration, and cognitive score were inversely proportional to the SHAP value. Female, rural residents, body aches and pains in any area, non-retirement, and limited Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) have a positive effect on depression. The local interpretation diagram based on SHAP and LIME showed the personalized risk prediction of a single sample. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Conclusions:&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Machine learning models are an effectively tool for predict the risk of depression. The use of SHapley Additive exPlanations and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations can maximize the clinical advantages of machine learning, which is helpful to predict or detect patients at high risk of depression as early as possible, and to take comprehensive evaluation and early prevention and treatment of depression. </jats:p>",

Its abnormal activation is closely related to various myeloproliferative neoplasms and inflammatory diseases. Developing selective JAK2 inhibitors is an important direction in drug discovery. Accurate prediction of compound inhibitory activity (pIC50) against JAK2 is crucial for accelerating the discovery and optimization of lead compounds. Objective: This study aims to utilize public resources from the ChEMBL database, combined with machine learning methods, to build a computational model capable of efficiently and accurately predicting the pIC50 values of JAK2 inhibitors. Methods: We collected compounds targeting human JAK2 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL2971) and their IC50 (nM) activity data from the ChEMBL database. After data cleaning (retaining only precise values with standard_relation = '=') and standardization (converting IC50 to pIC50, retaining the average pIC50 for duplicate compounds), a dataset containing 5546 compounds was finally obtained. RDKit (version 2022.9.5) was used to calculate Morgan fingerprints (radius=2, 2048 bits), MACCS Keys fingerprints (167 bits), and 13 physicochemical and topological descriptors. Based on feature importance calculated during the data processing phase (derived from preliminary model evaluation), the top 350 features were selected. However, due to the absence of some features in the current dataset, the final model used 345 features. The dataset was randomly split into training (n=4436) and test sets (n=1110) at an 80:20 ratio. The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, version 3.0.0) algorithm was used to build the prediction model, and hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree, gamma, reg_alpha, reg_lambda) were optimized using 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearchCV. An early stopping strategy was employed during the final model training to prevent overfitting. Results: After hyperparameter optimization, the final XGBoost model demonstrated good predictive performance on the independent test set, achieving a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.7184, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.5968, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.4593. Performance metrics on the training set (R²=0.8978) also indicated a good model fit, and the gap between training and test set performance was within an acceptable range, suggesting that overfitting was effectively controlled. Conclusion: This study successfully constructed an XGBoost-based prediction model for JAK2 inhibitor pIC50. Utilizing easily accessible molecular descriptors, the model demonstrated high prediction accuracy and robustness on an external test set.

There are several machine-learning techniques available to classify DNA sequences. Traits from known diseases are extracted to train the model for new, unknown diseases. The expansion of patients' access to digital platforms for early disease diagnosis through knowledge transfer to artificial neural networks eliminates the need for clinical equipment. To analyze the model, DNA samples of four well-known viruses—human respiratory viruses, lung cancer viruses, and papilla-maviruses (HPV)—are gathered from Genbank (NCBI). These samples are then compared with five existing methods using seven different parameters—specificity, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, recall, precision, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC), and area under the Precision-Recall (PRC) curve (AUPRC)—to facilitate the analysis of the model. The outcome demonstrates that the proposed work provides significantly better precision and accuracy than the prior best results, where precision has increased by more than 5.124% and accuracy has increased by about 15.9%.</p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Improving the current level of skill in seasonal climate prediction is urgent for achieving sustainable socioeconomic development, and this is especially true in China where meteorological disasters are experienced frequently. In this study, based upon big climate data and traditional statistical prediction experiences, a merged machine learning model (Y-model) was developed to address this, as well as to further explore unknown potential predictors. In Y-model, empirical orthogonal function analysis was firstly applied to reduce the data dimensionality of the target predictand (temperature and precipitation in the four seasons over China). Image recognition techniques were used to automatically identify possible predictors from the big climate data. These predictors, associated with significant circulation anomalies, were recombined into a large ensemble according to different threshold settings for five factors determining the statistical forecast skill. Facebook Prophet was chosen to conduct the independent hindcasts for each season&amp;#8217;s climate at a lead time of two months. During 2011~2022, the seasonal climate in China was skillfully predicted by Y-model, with an averaged pattern correlation coefficient skill of 0.60 for temperature and 0.24 for precipitation, outperforming CFSv2. Potential predictor analysis for recent extreme events suggested that prior signals from the Indian Ocean and the stratosphere were important for determining the super Mei-yu in 2020, while the prior sea surface temperature over the western Pacific and the soil temperature over West Asia may have contributed to the extreme high temperatures in 2022. Our study provides new insights for seasonal climate prediction in China.</jats:p>",

Methodology: This research incorporates the dataset of the “Centres for Disease Control and Prevention National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,” which was available on GitHub. After that, pre-processing of the dataset was done using the infinite latent feature selection (ILFS) algorithm to extract the appropriate features from the dataset. After that, the dataset was split into 70:30 ratios. About 70% of the data is employed for training the machine learning algorithm, while the remaining 30% is used for testing. Further, for classification purposes, multiple machine learning algorithms were taken into consideration using the ensemble learning classifier, and the final prediction was made based on the voting classifier. The voting classifier helps determine which machine learning algorithm has superior performance over other machine learning algorithms. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated via simulation on the dataset, with a number of metrics for performance being obtained. Finding: The result demonstrates that the suggested model achieves a high-value accuracy of 0.9166, a prediction value of 0.9177, a sensitivity value of 0.9984, a specificity value of 0.9984, and an F1-Score value of 0.9564. Finally, the comparison shows that the proposed mode outperforms machine learning algorithms, namely, ANN, XGBoost, Adaboost, random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, and SVM. Novelty: The proposed model was classified using various machine learning algorithms in place of one. Therefore, the accuracy of the proposed model was high.

Early and accurate prediction of CVD is crucial to reduce its impact and improve patient outcomes. This paper presents a hybrid model combining machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for precise prediction of cardiovascular disease. We utilized two public heart disease datasets with 70,000 and 1,190 records, along with a locally collected dataset containing 600 records. Our model incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks as the deep learning components, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and XGBoost (XGB) as the machine learning components. Majority voting was employed as an ensemble method to combine the outputs of the classifiers, producing the final prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved superior classification performance across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability for forecasting cardiovascular disease.</jats:p>",

Methods A cross-sectional study of 1546 CSs were conducted in Shanghai China. Self-reported structured questionnaire was used to collect information about basic socio-demographic factors, socioeconomic status, life behavior, health conditions, fatigue, social support, anxiety (Zung self-rating anxiety scale) and depression (Zung self - rating depression scale). Stepwise logistic regression and three machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) were used to construct the prediction model of CS’ CAD. Results 18.24% CSs reported CAD. The AUC of models to predict the high-risk CAD in the training set was best in that of RF (0.839), followed by LR (0.811), SVM (0.808), and DT (0.794). Social support and several comorbid chronic diseases were important top ranking contributing factors of CAD in all the predictive models. Conclusion CAD was a common psychological problems in cancer survivors (CSs).The machine leaning techniques and logistic regression showed similar performance to classify Chinese CSs at risk of CAD using questionnaire-based survey. Effective treatment to control the coexisting disease, more social support should be provided to CSs to improve psychological health. Psychological care was recommend to be incorporated into regular health care and management of cancer survivors.</p>",

    "abstract_findings": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant public health issue. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models using biopsychosocial predictors to predict the risk of PPD for perinatal women and to provide several risk assessment tools for the early detection of PPD. Candidate predictors, including history of mental illness and demographic, psychosocial, and physiological factors, were obtained from 1138 perinatal women between August 2021 and August 2022. The primary outcome of PPD was measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at 6 weeks postpartum. Seven feature selection methods and six ML algorithms were employed to develop models, and their prediction performances were compared. A total of 11 potential predictive factors associated with PPD were identified and subsequently used to construct prenatal and postpartum predictive models for PPD. The cross-validation results showed that the models built on logistic regression (LR) [area under the curve (AUC): 0.801, 0.858] and artificial neural network (ANN) (AUC: 0.787, 0.844) algorithms exhibited the best prediction performance. In contrast to the prenatal models, the addition of postpartum predictors (primary caregiver and mother-in-law’s care) remarkably improved the predictive performance of the postpartum models. The risk-stratification score, the nomogram, and the Shapley additive explanation were used to visualize and interpret the risk prediction model for predicting PPD in the early stage. The LR and ANN models achieved the best predictive performances. Applying these models and risk assessment tools to early predict and screen PPD has several implications for public health.",

    "abstract_findings": "After giving birth, postpartum depression is a serious mental health problem that affects moms. Symptoms may include trouble bonding with the child, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, and extreme irritability. Among 50 % of the mothers experience major changes in their mental health and approximately 1 in 10 women will seek help.The typical duration of postpartum depression is 3 to 6 months, however this might vary depending on a number of factors. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) data set, which is gathered after a week from the mothers who gave birth to their children, is used in this study to train the model using Random forest algorithm.This model has two phases, where the first phase predicts the status of the mother in any one of the four ranges (Depressed, Most Likely Depressed, Likely Depressed, No Depression) based on the trained data. Where the second phase predicts the level of depression(0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 Moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20- 27 severe.) based on the PHQ-9 Questionnaire, and it is suggested to take post-6 weeks of delivery. The results of phase one and two will be sent to the user via mail when they take the assessments in week one and week 6 respectively. The key benefit of this model is that there is no need for a third party because user and model evaluations take place directly between them. Since postpartum depression is not properly understood, many mothers do not receive treatment for their sickness, which can result in terrible circumstances and can be avoided by following this approach.",

This study aimed to develop an explainable machine learning model to predict the risk of PPD and to identify its key predictive factors. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,065 women who attended their 6-week postpartum follow-up visit at a tertiary maternal and child healthcare hospital in Shenyang, China, from January to December 2021. Feature selection was performed using LASSO regression and the Boruta algorithm. Eight machine learning algorithms were then employed to construct the prediction models. Model performance was evaluated according to the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to visualize the features of the model and individual case predictions. Results Among the 1,065 women, 251 (23.5%) developed PPD. An 11-variable prediction model was developed, with XGBoost showing the best performance on both training and validation sets. After optimizing the model parameters and applying 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieved an average accuracy of 0.95, an average AUC of 0.955, average precision of 0.945, and average specificity of 0.985, indicating excellent predictive performance. The key predictive factors included weight gain during pregnancy, relationship with the mother-in-law, sleep quality, marital relationship, planned pregnancy, fetal sex preference, pregnancy-related anxiety, pelvic-floor muscle endurance, cervix status, attendance at prenatal education classes, and postpartum care satisfaction. Conclusion The XGBoost model demonstrated optimal performance at predicting PPD and can aid healthcare professionals to identify high-risk individuals. The SHAP method enhanced the model’s interpretability, facilitating a better understanding of the causes of PPD, how to prevent it, and how to improve patient outcomes.",

The COVID-19 pandemic, the consequential lockdowns and related safety restrictions worldwide negatively affected the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: This regional study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for the prediction of maternal depression and anxiety. The study used a dataset collected from five Arab countries during the COVID-19 pandemic between July to December 2020. The population sample included 3569 women (1939 pregnant and 1630 postpartum) from five countries (Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain). The performance of seven machine learning algorithms was assessed for the prediction of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: The Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models outperformed other studied ML algorithms with accuracy values of 83.3% and 83.2% for depression, respectively, and values of 82.9% and 81.3% for anxiety, respectively. The Mathew’s Correlation Coefficient was evaluated for the ML models; the Naïve Bayes (NB) and GB models presented the highest performance measures (0.63 and 0.59) for depression and (0.74 and 0.73) for anxiety, respectively. The features’ importance ranking was evaluated, the results showed that stress during pregnancy, family support, financial issues, income, and social support were the most significant values in predicting anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Overall, the study evidenced the power of ML models in predicting maternal depression and anxiety and proved to be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated risk factors that influence maternal mental health. The deployment of machine learning models for screening and early detection of depression and anxiety among pregnant and postpartum women might facilitate the development of health prevention and intervention programs that will enhance maternal and child health in low- and middle-income countries.",

Exploring reliable predictors is crucial for the early and accurate prediction of PPD, which remains challenging. Objective This study aimed to comprehensively collect variables from multiple aspects, develop and validate machine learning models to achieve precise prediction of PPD, and interpret the model to reveal clinical implications. Methods This study recruited pregnant women who delivered at the West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University. Various variables were collected from electronic medical record data and screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty regression. Participants were divided into training (1358/2055, 66.1%) and validation (697/2055, 33.9%) sets by random sampling. Machine learning–based predictive models were developed in the training cohort. Models were validated in the validation cohort with receiver operating curve and decision curve analysis. Multiple model interpretation methods were implemented to explain the optimal model. Results We recruited 2055 participants in this study. The extreme gradient boosting model was the optimal predictive model with the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.849. Shapley Additive Explanation indicated that the most influential predictors of PPD were antepartum depression, lower fetal weight, elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone, declined thyroid peroxidase antibodies, elevated serum ferritin, and older age. Conclusions This study developed and validated a machine learning–based predictive model for PPD. Several significant risk factors and how they impact the prediction of PPD were revealed. These findings provide new insights into the early screening of individuals with high risk for PPD, emphasizing the need for comprehensive screening approaches that include both physiological and psychological factors.",

This study analyzed plasma samples from 30 healthy postpartum women and 30 PPD-risk women using mass spectrometry, identifying 98 differentially expressed proteins (29 upregulated and 69 downregulated). Principal component analysis revealed distinct protein expression profiles between the groups. Functional enrichment and PPI analyses further explored the biological functions of these proteins. Machine learning models (XGBoost and LASSO regression) identified 17 key proteins, with the optimal logistic regression model comprising P13797 (PLS3), P56750 (CLDN17), O43173 (ST8SIA3), P01593 (IGKV1D–33), and P43243 (MATR3). The model demonstrated excellent predictive performance through ROC curves, calibration, and decision curves. These findings suggest potential biomarkers for early PPD risk assessment, paving the way for personalized prediction. However, limitations include the lack of diagnostic interviews, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID), to confirm PPD diagnosis, a small sample size, and limited ethnic diversity, affecting generalizability. Future studies should expand sample diversity, confirm diagnoses with SCID, and validate biomarkers in larger cohorts to ensure their clinical applicability.",

    "abstract_findings": "Perinatal depression (PND) is a complication of pregnancy associated with serious health consequences for both mothers and their babies. Identifying predisposing factors for PND during early pregnancy is key to early detection of women who may be at greater risk of developing this condition. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have recently been applied in a few studies, mostly to predict postpartum depression. None of them, however, considered sleep data in model building, neither focused on PND. By analyzing data from a multicenter, prospective cohort study on sleep and mood changes during the perinatal period (the “Life-ON” study), we constructed a ML model for PND risk prediction and tested it in a cross-validation setting. PND was assessed using an EPDS score >12 during 9 visits from early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. In a bivariate analysis, 47 sociodemographic, psychological, blood-based, medical/gynecological, and subjective sleep variables, collected from 439 pregnant women (33.7±4.2 yrs.) during the first trimester of gestation, as well as 33 polysomnographic (PSG) parameters, recorded from 353 women (33.6±4.2 yrs.) during the second trimester, were correlated with PND. A support vector machine (SVM) model was then trained using the 10-features with the highest permutation importance to predict the individual risk of PND for each woman. Among all variables considered, sleep quality (PSQI) and insomnia symptoms (ISI) (p< 0.001), daytime sleepiness (ESS) and RLS severity (IRLS) (p< 0.05), as well as the PSG parameters Apnea Index (p=0.001), number of central hypopneas and percentage of sleep stage N2 (p< 0.05), were all positively correlated to PND. The PSQI and ISI scores were also selected by the SVM classifier, which achieved a mean AUROC of 0.777 and an AUPRC of 0.393, corresponding to a sensitivity of 54.3% and a specificity of 82.6% in identifying women at risk for PND. In our data-driven ML model to predict the risk of PND during early pregnancy, subjective poor sleep quality and insomnia symptoms identified women at greater risk of developing PND, while none of the PSG variables improved model performance.

Prediction of high risk can allow for early delivery of existing interventions for prevention. This ongoing study aims to use digital phenotyping data from the Mom2B smartphone application to develop models to predict women at high risk for mental and somatic complications. Methods and analysis All Swedish-speaking women over 18 years, who are either pregnant or within 3 months postpartum are eligible to participate by downloading the Mom2B smartphone app. We aim to recruit at least 5000 participants with completed outcome measures. Throughout the pregnancy and within the first year postpartum, both active and passive data are collected via the app in an effort to establish a participant’s digital phenotype. Active data collection consists of surveys related to participant background information, mental and physical health, lifestyle, and social circumstances, as well as voice recordings. Participants’ general smartphone activity, geographical movement patterns, social media activity and cognitive patterns can be estimated through passive data collection from smartphone sensors and activity logs. The outcomes will be measured using surveys, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and through linkage to national registers, from where information on registered clinical diagnoses and received care, including prescribed medication, can be obtained. Advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques will be applied to these multimodal data in order to develop accurate algorithms for the prediction of perinatal depression and preterm birth. In this way, earlier intervention may be possible. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr: 2019/01170, with amendments), and the project fully fulfils the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. All participants provide consent to participate and can withdraw their participation at any time. Results from this project will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed journals and presented in relevant conferences.",

    "abstract_findings": "Advances in public health and medical care have enabled better pregnancy and birth outcomes. The rates of perinatal health indicators such as maternal mortality and morbidity; fetal, neonatal, and infant mortality; low birthweight; and preterm birth have reduced over time. However, they are still a public health concern, and considerable disparities exist within and between countries. For perinatal researchers who are engaged in unraveling the tangled web of causation for maternal and child health outcomes and for clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women and infants, artificial intelligence offers novel approaches to prediction modeling, diagnosis, early detection, and monitoring in perinatal health. Machine learning, a commonly used artificial intelligence method, has been used to predict preterm birth, birthweight, preeclampsia, mortality, hypertensive disorders, and postpartum depression. Real-time electronic health recording and predictive modeling using artificial intelligence have found early success in fetal monitoring and monitoring of women with gestational diabetes especially in low-resource settings. Artificial intelligence–based methodologies have the potential to improve prenatal diagnosis of birth defects and outcomes in assisted reproductive technology too. In this scenario, we envision artificial intelligence for perinatal research to be based on three goals: (1) availability of population-representative, routine clinical data (rich multimodal data of large sample size) for perinatal research; (2) modification and application of current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for prediction and classification in health care research to the field of perinatal health; and (3) development of methods for explaining the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence models for perinatal health indicators. Achieving these three goals via a multidisciplinary approach to the development of artificial intelligence tools will enable trust in these tools and advance research, clinical practice, and policies to ensure optimal perinatal health.",

    "abstract_findings": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant mental health concern affecting mothers worldwide, irrespective of demographic factors. Detecting and managing PPD at an early stage is crucial for effective intervention. In the context of mental health, intelligent predictive models based on machine learning (ML) have emerged as valuable tools. However, there remains a relative scarcity of research specifically targeting postpartum mental health due to several prominent factors that collectively impede the widespread adoption and practical implementation of ML in the field of PPD. This paper provides an updated overview of ML approaches for PPD prediction. A systematic search across IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus yielded 1,074 relevant articles. The performance of ML algorithms varies depending on the dataset and the problem being addressed. Notably, the findings reveal that the random forest (RF) algorithm consistently demonstrates the highest predictive accuracy, followed by support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), XGBoost, and AdaBoost. The development of advanced data techniques in PPD has encouraged interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in psychiatry and computer science that holds great potential for refining the accuracy and reliability of PPD predictive models, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes for mothers and their families through early detection, intervention, and support.",

With prevalence rates rising and the multifaceted etiology of PPD complicating early diagnosis, traditional screening tools—while useful—often fall short in capturing the broad spectrum of social, behavioral, and clinical risk factors. This literature review examines the evolution of computational methodologies employed to predict PPD, with particular emphasis on machine learning (ML) approaches, IoT-based monitoring, social media analytics, and neuro-fuzzy models. We analyze studies that range from personalized maternal sleep quality assessments using IoT devices to advanced deep neural network models for risk classification. In comparing these techniques, we discuss their predictive accuracies, advantages, limitations, and the inherent trade-offs between continuous monitoring, real-time insights, and computational complexity. Our synthesis reveals that while ML-based risk prediction models tend to provide high accuracy, challenges remain in data integration, model interpretability, and the generalizability of results across diverse populations. Finally, we outline the key areas for future research, including the development of robust, real-time screening systems that integrate multiple data sources and the need for culturally adapted models.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background Postpartum depression (PPD) has emerged as a global public health issue that can cause significant harm to mothers and their families. Currently, there is an urgent need for a robust early risk prediction model to enable accurate predictions of postpartum depression in hospitals. Methods This was a longitudinal study. Using social ecosystem theory, we collected multi-dimensional and multi-angle risk factors for early postpartum depression from delivery to discharge, and conducted 42-day postpartum follow-ups using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). We strictly adhered to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, used 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms to construct and validate the prediction model, and employed the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) algorithm to explain the model. Risk stratification was performed through K-Means clustering analysis, ultimately resulting in an clinical screening tool for early PPD risk prediction. Results The results showed that by comparing the performance of prediction models constructed by the 10 ML algorithms, the model constructed using the random forest algorithm was selected as the best, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85–0.96) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70–0.85) in internal and external validation. Low risk probability (0, 0.26], medium risk probability (0.26, 0.63), and high risk probability (0.63, 1) were obtained through K-Means clustering analysis, and the SHAP value of the model was interpreted. Finally, we developed an online risk prediction calculator. Conclusion This study developed an interpretable risk prediction model for early PPD, which may help healthcare providers to identify and implement intervention measures early, preventing the occurrence of PPD.",

    "abstract_findings": "This study explores the development of an ensemble machine learning (ML) model to predict Postpartum Depression (PPD) disorder, leveraging chi-square test driven feature selection techniques and a diverse array of ML algorithms. Initially, chi-square test is employed to select the most influential features for PPD prediction. From a pool of candidate features, nine key attributes demonstrating the highest association with PPD are identified for model input. Subsequently, eight distinct ML techniques, including K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), XG Boost (XGB), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), are applied to develop individual predictive models. Following the training and evaluation of individual models, an ensemble approach is adopted to combine the strengths of multiple algorithms, enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness. The ensemble model aggregates predictions from diverse ML techniques, leveraging their complementary strengths to yield more accurate and reliable predictions of PPD risk. Performance evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are employed to assess the efficacy of the ensemble model in comparison to individual ML algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble approach in improving prediction accuracy and generalization capability, thereby offering a valuable tool for early identification and intervention in PPD cases. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive modelling in mental health by showcasing the utility of ensemble ML techniques in PPD prediction. The findings underscore the potential of feature selection and ensemble modelling in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of PPD risk assessment, thereby facilitating proactive interventions to support maternal mental health.",

Methods: Serum samples were collected from 53 patients diagnosed with PPD and 35 healthy controls. Cytokine levels were measured using a flow cytometer analyzer. Machine learning models, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), were developed to predict PPD and comorbid anxiety based on cytokine levels. Results: Patients with PPD exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of IL-6 compared to the control group. A positive correlation was found between psychological anxiety scores and IL-6 levels (r = 0.483, P < .001). Machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest and SVMs, demonstrated high accuracy in predicting PPD and comorbid anxiety, with IL-6 being identified as a key predictor. Conclusion: The activation of serum cytokines is evident in PPD patients, with IL-6 potentially serving as an auxiliary biomarker for the diagnosis of PPD and comorbid anxiety. The incorporation of machine learning techniques has enhanced the understanding of the complex relationships between cytokines and PPD, with IL-6 levels showing a correlation to the severity of clinical symptoms.",

A sample of 944 U.S. patient participants from a larger longitudinal observational cohortused a prenatal support mobile app from September 2019 to April 2022. Participants self-reported clinical and social risk factors during first trimester initiation of app use and completed voluntary depression screenings in each trimester. Several machine learning algorithms were applied to self-reported data, including a novel algorithm for causal discovery. Training and test datasets were built from a randomized 80/20 data split. Models were evaluated on their predictive accuracy and their simplicity (i.e., fewest variables required for prediction). Among participants, 78% identified as white with an average age of 30 [IQR 26–34]; 61% had income ≥ $50,000; 70% had a college degree or higher; and 49% were nulliparous. All models accurately predicted first time moderate-severe depression using first trimester baseline data (AUC 0.74–0.89, sensitivity 0.35–0.81, specificity 0.78–0.95). Several predictors were common across models, including anxiety history, partnered status, psychosocial factors, and pregnancy-specific stressors. The optimal model used only 14 (26%) of the possible variables and had excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.83). When food insecurity reports were included among a subset of participants, demographics, including race and income, dropped out and the model became more accurate (AUC = 0.93) and simpler (9 variables).

WB001 combines therapeutic alliance, human-centered design, machine learning techniques, and established principles from CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT). We introduce AGCBT as a new model of service delivery, whilst describing Woebot, the agent technology that enables guidance through the replication of some elements of human relationships. The profile describes the device’s design principles, enabling technology, risk handling, and efficacy data in PPD. Expert opinion WB001 is a dynamic and personalized tool with which patients may establish a therapeutic bond. Woebot is designed to augment (rather than replace) human healthcare providers, unlocking the therapeutic potency associated with guidance, whilst retaining the scalability and agency that characterizes self-help approaches.

This study aims to employ ensemble learning techniques, utilizing C4.5 decision tree (DT), gradient boosting tree (GBT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to predict the occurrences of PPD in the Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia. The predictive model developed encompasses a dataset comprising 317 records gathered from postpartum mothers in hospitals, community health services, and midwifery clinics (referred to as Model 1). Furthermore, resampling techniques (Model 2) were employed to address class imbalance. Additionally, feature selection including forward selection and backward elimination (Model 3) were implemented to enhance model performance. The findings reveal that XGBoost, combined with resampling methods, achieved the highest accuracy rate at 87.57%. Feature selection identified five crucial factors associated with PPD incidence: marital status, number of living children, history of depression, fear of delivery, and family relationships. The utilization of ensemble learning strategies for PPD prediction yields reliable outcomes that can be applied within clinical settings. Exploring alternative ensemble learning strategies such as random forest and adaptive boosting could further optimize model performance and warrant consideration in future research endeavours.",

These platforms offer ample data for extracting user opinions, which can be examined through natural language processing and text analysis methods. This project uses these techniques to systematically discover, gather, measure, and examine emotional states and personal information in posts on Twitter and Reddit. Our primary goal is to predict depression in these posts, which is a significant public health concern. To achieve this, we use a combined dataset of Twitter and Reddit data. Our research aims to add to the increasing field of investigation on using social media data to comprehend and forecast mental health outcomes. By identifying patterns and trends in language use that may be indicative of depression, we hope to provide insights that can inform the development of interventions and support for individuals at risk of mental health challenges.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background Depression affects more than 350 million people globally. Traditional diagnostic methods have limitations. Analyzing textual data from social media provides new insights into predicting depression using machine learning. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews in this area, which necessitates further research. Objective This review aims to assess the effectiveness of user-generated social media texts in predicting depression and evaluate the influence of demographic, language, social media activity, and temporal features on predicting depression on social media texts through machine learning. Methods We searched studies from 11 databases (CINHAL [through EBSCOhost], PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ProQuest, IEEE Explore, and ACM digital library) from January 2008 to August 2023. We included studies that used social media texts, machine learning, and reported area under the curve, Pearson r, and specificity and sensitivity (or data used for their calculation) to predict depression. Protocol papers and studies not written in English were excluded. We extracted study characteristics, population characteristics, outcome measures, and prediction factors from each study. A random effects model was used to extract the effect sizes with 95% CIs. Study heterogeneity was evaluated using forest plots and P values in the Cochran Q test. Moderator analysis was performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Results A total of 36 studies were included. We observed a significant overall correlation between social media texts and depression, with a large effect size (r=0.630, 95% CI 0.565-0.686). We noted the same correlation and large effect size for demographic (largest effect size; r=0.642, 95% CI 0.489-0.757), social media activity (r=0.552, 95% CI 0.418-0.663), language (r=0.545, 95% CI 0.441-0.649), and temporal features (r=0.531, 95% CI 0.320-0.693). The social media platform type (public or private; P<.001), machine learning approach (shallow or deep; P=.048), and use of outcome measures (yes or no; P<.001) were significant moderators. Sensitivity analysis revealed no change in the results, indicating result stability. The Begg-Mazumdar rank correlation (Kendall τb=0.22063; P=.058) and the Egger test (2-tailed t34=1.28696; P=.207) confirmed the absence of publication bias. Conclusions Social media textual content can be a useful tool for predicting depression. Demographics, language, social media activity, and temporal features should be considered to maximize the accuracy of depression prediction models. Additionally, the effects of social media platform type, machine learning approach, and use of outcome measures in depression prediction models need attention. Analyzing social media texts for depression prediction is challenging, and findings may not apply to a broader population. Nevertheless, our findings offer valuable insights for future research.

Unfortunately, only 60% of pregnant women at high risk for PPH are identified, leaving 40% undetected until they experience PPH. To address this critical issue and ensure timely intervention, leveraging rapidly advancing technology with machine learning (ML) methodologies for maternal health prediction is imperative. This review synthesizes findings from 43 selected research articles, highlighting the predominant ML techniques employed in PPH prediction. Among these, logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) emerge as the most frequently utilized methods. By harnessing the power of ML, we aim to foster technological advancements in the healthcare sector, with a particular focus on maternal health and ultimately contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality rates worldwide.",

Method A retrospective cohort study of all GDM women (n = 607) for postpartum glucose test due between January 2016 and December 2019 at the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, UK. Results Sixty-five percent of women attended postpartum glucose test. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 2.8% and 21.6% had persistent dysglycaemia at 6–13 weeks post-delivery. Those who did not attend postpartum glucose test seem to be younger, multiparous, obese, and continued to smoke during pregnancy. They also had higher fasting glucose at antenatal oral glucose tolerance test. Our machine learning algorithm predicted postpartum glucose non-attendance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72. The model could achieve a sensitivity of 70% with 66% specificity at a risk score threshold of 0.46. A total of 233 (38.4%) women attended subsequent glucose test at least once within the first two years of delivery and 24% had dysglycaemia. Compared to women who attended postpartum glucose test, those who did not attend had higher conversion rate to type 2 diabetes (2.5% vs 11.4%; p = 0.005). Conclusion Postpartum screening following GDM is still poor. Women who did not attend postpartum screening appear to have higher metabolic risk and higher conversion to type 2 diabetes by two years post-delivery. Machine learning model can predict women who are unlikely to attend postpartum glucose test using simple antenatal factors. Enhanced, personalised education of these women may improve postpartum glucose screening.",

Methods A total of 286 mothers were selected using convenience sampling, who came for a routine postpartum follow-up visit were surveyed, including face-to-face, telephone, and online. They completed questionnaires including the basic profile questionnaire, Postpartum Partner Support Scale (PPSS), Edinburgh PPD Scale (EPDS), Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale (SICS), and Simple Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), who were advised to complete the survey alone, in private, reducing the impact of husband’s presence on the quality of the questionnaire. Variables showing statistical significance in the one-way analysis were further analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The predictive value of the logistic regression model was analyzed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), and the predictive reliability was expressed as the area under the ROC [Area Under the Curve (AUC)]. Results The total score of PPD was 7.78 ± 4.57, and 22 people (7.69%) experienced depression during the postpartum period. PPD was found to be correlated with postpartum partner support, positive coping, negative coping, and parenting self-efficacy, with correlation coefficient values of −0.63, 0.62, 0.56, and − 0.70, respectively (all p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that postpartum partner support and parenting self-efficacy were independent factors influencing PPD, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.76 (0.61 ~ 0.94) and 0.83 (0.75 ~ 0.93), respectively both p < 0.05.The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for postpartum partner support and parenting self-efficacy were 1.00 (95% confidence intervals 0.99 ~ 1.00), 99.24, and 90.91%. Conclusion Postpartum partner support and parenting self-efficacy independently predict the occurrence of PPD. Healthcare professionals and maternal families should prioritize timely attention to maternal partner support and parenting issues to reduce the occurrence of PPD.",

The aim of this review is to summarize existing literature in which machine learning methods have been used in combination with Electronic Health Records for prediction of depression. Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted within arXiv, PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct, SCOPUS and Web of Science electronic databases. Searches were restricted to information published after 2010 (from 1st January 2011 onwards) and were updated prior to the final synthesis of data (27th January 2022). Results Following the PRISMA process, the initial 744 studies were reduced to 19 eligible for detailed evaluation. Data extraction identified machine learning methods used, types of predictors used, the definition of depression, classification performance achieved, sample size, and benchmarks used. Area Under the Curve (AUC) values more than 0.9 were claimed, though the average was around 0.8. Regression methods proved as effective as more developed machine learning techniques. Limitations The categorization, definition, and identification of the numbers of predictors used within models was sometimes difficult to establish, Studies were largely Western Educated Industrialised, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) in demography. Conclusion This review supports the potential use of machine learning techniques with Electronic Health Records for the prediction of depression. All the selected studies used clinically based, though sometimes broad, definitions of depression as their classification criteria. The reported performance of the studies was comparable to or even better than that found in primary care. There are concerns with generalizability and interpretability.",

    "abstract_findings": "Depression is specified as a mental health disease that leads to continual gloomy mood and detached interest in daily tasks, which a person was able to do easily and showed much interest normally, thus crippling a person’s daily life. It’s important to identify the symptoms of mental health problems early in a person as there are many conditions for which effective treatments work best during the early stages thus preventing the aggravation of the disease. Over the past decade, Machine learning techniques have become immensely popular for examining the medically available data and identifying the root issue. In this work, we also use a machine learning based approach to propose a response-based classifier that uses just a quick questionnaire to diagnose and predict the early onset of depression in a person being screened. The questionnaire used in our approach has been designed strictly based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM- 5). In particular, our approach uses the responses made by the person being screened to predict depression, using a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In general, the classifier is straightforward, computationally lightweight, and can predict depression with 83.87% accuracy. We also test our proposed method on a Kashmir-based dataset.",

    "abstract_findings": "This study addresses a gap in research on predictive models for postpartum dyslipidemia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict postpartum dyslipidemia using early pregnancy clinical data, and the model’s robustness was evaluated through both internal and temporal validation. Clinical data from 15,946 pregnant women were utilized. After cleaning, the data were divided into two sets: Dataset A (n = 1,116), used for training and evaluating the model, and Dataset B (n = 707), used for temporal validation. Several machine learning algorithms were applied, and the performance of the model was assessed with Dataset A, while Dataset B was used to validate the model across a different time period. Feature significance was evaluated through Information Value (IV), model importance analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The results showed that among the five machine learning algorithms tested, tree-based ensemble models, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest, outperformed others in predicting postpartum dyslipidemia. In Dataset A, these models achieved accuracies of 70.54%, 70.54%, and 69.64%, respectively, with AUC-ROC values of 73.10%, 71.94%, and 76.14%. Temporal validation with Dataset B indicated that XGBoost performed best, achieving an accuracy of 81.05% and an AUC-ROC of 87.92%. The predictive power of the model was strengthened by key variables such as total cholesterol, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and BMI, with total cholesterol being identified as the most important feature. Further IV and SHAP analyses confirmed the pivotal role of these variables in predicting dyslipidemia. The study concluded that the XGBoost-based predictive model for postpartum dyslipidemia in GDM showed strong and consistent performance in both internal and temporal validations. By introducing new variables, the model can identify high-risk groups during early pregnancy, supporting early intervention and potentially improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing complications.",

    "abstract_findings": "Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents a multifaceted medical condition that requires early detection and diagnosis for effective management, given its diverse presentations and subtle symptoms that manifest from birth. This research article introduces a groundbreaking healthcare application, the Machine Learning-based Congenital Heart Disease Prediction Method (ML-CHDPM), tailored to address these challenges and expedite the timely identification and classification of CHD in pregnant women. The ML-CHDPM model leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to categorize CHD cases, taking into account pertinent clinical and demographic factors. Trained on a comprehensive dataset, the model captures intricate patterns and relationships, resulting in precise predictions and classifications. The evaluation of the model’s performance encompasses sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Remarkably, the findings underscore the ML-CHDPM’s superiority across six pivotal metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, false positive rate (FPR), and false negative rate (FNR). The method achieves an average accuracy rate of 94.28%, precision of 87.54%, recall rate of 96.25%, specificity rate of 91.74%, FPR of 8.26%, and FNR of 3.75%. These outcomes distinctly demonstrate the ML-CHDPM’s effectiveness in reliably predicting and classifying CHD cases. This research marks a significant stride toward early detection and diagnosis, harnessing advanced machine learning techniques within the realm of ECG signal processing, specifically tailored to pregnant women.",

    "abstract_findings": "Objective Depression is very common and harmful in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). It is necessary to screen OSAHS patients for depression early. However, there are no validated tools to assess the likelihood of depression in patients with OSAHS. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and machine learning (ML) methods to construct a risk prediction model for depression, aiming to predict the probability of depression in the OSAHS population. Relevant features were analyzed and a nomogram was drawn to visually predict and easily estimate the risk of depression according to the best performing model. Study design This is a cross-sectional study. Methods Data from three cycles (2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2015–2016) were selected from the NHANES database, and 16 influencing factors were screened and included. Three prediction models were established by the logistic regression algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm, and random forest algorithm, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess evaluate and compare the different ML models. Results The logistic regression model had lower sensitivity than the lasso model, while the specificity and AUC area were higher than the random forest and lasso models. Moreover, when the threshold probability range was 0.19–0.25 and 0.45–0.82, the net benefit of the logistic regression model was the largest. The logistic regression model clarified the factors contributing to depression, including gender, general health condition, body mass index (BMI), smoking, OSAHS severity, age, education level, ratio of family income to poverty (PIR), and asthma. Conclusion This study developed three machine learning (ML) models (logistic regression model, lasso model, and random forest model) using the NHANES database to predict depression and identify influencing factors among OSAHS patients. Among them, the logistic regression model was superior to the lasso and random forest models in overall prediction performance. By drawing the nomogram and applying it to the sleep testing center or sleep clinic, sleep technicians and medical staff can quickly and easily identify whether OSAHS patients have depression to carry out the necessary referral and psychological treatment.",

This paper reviews publications from online electronic databases from 2016 to 2020 that use machine learning techniques to predict depression. The aim of this study is to identify important variables used in depression prediction, recent depression screening tools adopted, and the latest machine learning algorithms used. This understanding provides researchers with the fundamental components essential to predict depression. Fifteen articles were found relevant. We based our review on the systematic mapping study (SMS) method. Three research questions were answered through this review. We discovered that sixteen variables were deemed important by the literature. Not all of the reviewed literature utilizes depression screening tools in the prediction process. Nevertheless, from the five screening tools discovered, the most frequently used were hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) for general population, while for literature targeting older population geriatric depression scale (GDS) was often employed. A total of twenty-two machine learning algorithms were identified employed to predict depression and random forest was found to be the most reliable algorithm across the publications.",

    "abstract_findings": "In developing countries, one-quarter of young women have suffered from anemia. However, the available studies in Ethiopia have been usually used the traditional stastical methods. Therefore, this study aimed to employ multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model for the prediction of anemia among youth girls in Ethiopia. A total of 5642 weighted samples of young girls from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey dataset were utilized. The data underwent preprocessing, with 80% of the observations used for training the model and 20% for testing. Eight machine learning algorithms were employed to build and compare models. The model performance was assessed using evaluation metrics in Python software. Various data balancing techniques were applied, and the Boruta algorithm was used to select the most relevant features. Besides, association rule mining was conducted using the Apriori algorithm in R software. The random forest classifier with an AUC value of 82% outperformed in predicting anemia among all the tested classifiers. Region, poor wealth index, no formal education, unimproved toilet facility, rural residence, not used contraceptive method, religion, age, no media exposure, occupation, and having more than 5 family size were the top attributes to predict anemia. Association rule mining was identified the top seven best rules that most frequently associated with anemia. The random forest classifier is the best for predicting anemia. Therefore, making it potentially valuable as decision-support tools for the relevant stakeholders and giving emphasis for the identified predictors could be an important intervention to halt anemia among youth girls.",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Aim: Postpartum depression is a highly prevalent disorder, and it has been recognized as a public health problem. In Chinese culture, after childbirth, women must stay at home for postpartum confinement. However, more than 50% of postpartum women tend to experience depression symptoms 3–4 days after delivery. Although the prevention and causes of postpartum depression have been extensively studied, the assessment tools used are usually based on Western cultures. A Chinese-version assessment scale was necessary. The objective of this study was to develop a culturally sensitive questionnaire for assessing the knowledge, attitude, and prevention behaviors toward postpartum depression of Taiwanese women, and examined the associations among postpartum depression knowledge, attitude, and prevention. Methods: Two-phase study was conducted. First, a postpartum depression scale was developed and its reliability and validity were tested in 50 people. Second, 639 postpartum women from seven hospitals were asked to complete the questionnaire. Results: The questionnaire, which contained four subscales and 16 questions (Cronbach's α = .82–.84), was administered in the postpartum room and required 5–10 min for completion. This questionnaire showed face validity and high acceptance, the factor analysis showed that the questionnaire has acceptable structural reliability. High scores on the postpartum depression knowledge and attitude subscales were associated with higher prevention behavior subscale scores. Conclusion: The finding of this questionnaire is an effective tool for determining postpartum women’s understanding of postpartum depression. Understanding postpartum depression knowledge, attitude and prevention are essential to assess and promote the postnatal care</jats:p>",

This study investigated the factors influencing maternal PPD and developed a predictive model using machine learning. Methods/Design: In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to identify significant predictors of PPD and to develop a model for classifying individuals at risk. Data from 2570 subjects were analyzed using the Korean Early Childhood Education and Care Panel (K-ECEC-P) dataset as of January 2025, utilizing Python version 3.12.8. Results: We compared the performance of a decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, AdaBoost classifier, and logistic regression model using metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve. The logistic regression model was selected as the best model. Among the 13 features analyzed, conflict with a partner, stress, and the value of children emerged as significant predictors of PPD. Discussion: Conflict with a partner and stress levels emerged as the strongest predictors. Higher levels of conflict and stress were associated with an increased likelihood of PPD, whereas a higher value of children reduced this risk. Maternal psychological status and environmental features should be managed carefully during the postpartum period.</jats:p>",

There are no predictive tools available to screen postpartum depression that also allow early interventions. We aimed to develop predictive models for postpartum depression using machine learning (ML) approaches. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2012–2013 with 28,755 records (3339 postpartum depression and 25,416 normal cases). The imbalance between the two groups was addressed by a balanced resampling using both random down-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique. Nine different ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting, support vector machines (SVM), recursive partitioning and regression trees, naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), logistic regression, and neural network, were employed with 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the models. The overall classification accuracies of the nine models ranged from 0.650 (kNN) to 0.791 (RF). The RF method achieved the highest area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.884, followed by SVM, which achieved the second-best performance with an AUC value of 0.864.

A generalized approach is proposed where linguistic features are extracted from user‐generated textual posts on social media and categorized as general, depressive, and PPD representative using multiple machine learning techniques. We find that techniques used in our study exhibit strong predictive capabilities for PPD content. Holdout validation showed that multilayer perceptron outperformed other techniques such as support vector machine and logistic regression used in this study with 91.7% accuracy for depressive content identification and up to 86.9% accuracy for PPD content prediction. This work adopts a hierarchical approach to predict PPD. Therefore, the reported PPD accuracy represents the performance of the model to correctly classify PPD content from non‐PPD depressive content.</jats:p>",

Model 3 utilized recursive feature elimination to construct a parsimonious model. Model 4 further titrated the input data to exclude pre-pregnancy mental health variables.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Of 8454 births, 338 (4%) were complicated by PPD. Model 3 was the highest performing, demonstrating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91(±0.02). Models 1-3 identified the 9 variables most predictive of depression hierarchically ranging from BMI (highest), prior depression, age, income, medications, education, past medical history, race, and prior anxiety (lowest). In model 4, the AUC remained at 0.80(±0.04).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Counterintuitively, the presence of pre-pregnancy mental health conditions is not the most predictive factor of PPD.

The reason is that the occurrence of earthquakes depends on many factors, which give rise to various anomalies that are used as precursors. However, because of the complexity of the earthquake process and the unavailability of much information about the detailed structure of the Earth's crust, a small number of them can accurately indicate future seismic events. The results of the application of machine learning and deep learning give hope for the possibility of obtaining more accurate information about future strong earthquakes if disparate factors are combined. To determine the most important signs of an earthquake and determine the spatial location of strong earthquakes in a specific seismically active territory of Uzbekistan, namely, in the Fergana depression, the Cora 3, Cora 4, random forest algorithms of machine learning and LSTM, ANN architectures of deep learning were implemented.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<title>Abstract</title> <p> <italic>The financial sector has experienced transformative advancements, particularly in predictive analytics and algorithmic trading. While advanced models excel at making accurate predictions and sound decisions, many existing systems struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions. This research exploits a novel application named the Dynamic Wild Horse-mutated Resilient Random Forest Classifier (DWH-RRFC), aiming at achieving superior accuracy in trend prediction of algorithmic trading systems. The research utilizes a multimodal data including historical prices, market sentiment scores, trading volumes, and macroeconomic indexes from major cryptocurrency markets. Z-score normalization scales input features such as price, volume, and market-related features to all have a mean equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to one during preprocessing. The presence of dimensionality reduction methods like PCA helps in minimizing information loss during feature selection. The DWH-RRFC adds a mutation mechanism inspired by the Wild Horse model, which refines the adaptability of traditional random forest algorithms. Allowing for dynamic boundary modifications to accurately respond to changing market circumstances. The model specializes in forecasting the short-term directional movement of prices. Consequently, traders can make precise and reasonable acquisitions and sales investments on the market's future performance. The experiment showings indicate that the system may work with incredible performance, about 97 percent in accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, toward commercial conventional classifiers. This paradigm constitutes a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of fiscal budgeting and creates a foundation for increasingly sophisticated trading automation in active environments.</italic> </p>",

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is utilized in the proposed model in order to keep track of user movement history which allows to discover more meaningful dependencies.

Therefore, stakeholders will pay close attention to the company's financial status. Based on this background, forecasting and evaluating the company's financial performance has important research value and significance for realizing the sustainable development of the company. BP neural network can automatically learn historical experience from data samples, and automatically estimate the function that can best describe the law of sample data. Therefore, this paper first analyzes the basic principles of BP neural network and artificial intelligence technology, and then evaluates its benefits, anti-risk ability, development ability and turnover ability, and designs the financial performance prediction and evaluation model from the above four perspectives to evaluate the 12 of the index system. Two secondary indicators are used as the input vector, and the comprehensive performance score is used as the output vector to create the BP neural network model. Finally, using the data of four companies as test samples, model training and simulation verification are carried out on the comprehensive performance of the sample companies, and the comprehensive performance of the sample companies is analyzed and explained according to the comparison of the prediction results. The results show that the prediction and evaluation method of enterprise financial performance based on BP neural network is feasible. In this paper, the artificial intelligence algorithm is introduced into the design of the financial prediction model of enterprise performance and efficiency by studying the artificial intelligence algorithm, so as to effectively assist the enterprise management.</jats:p>",

With the increasing availability of internet-based data, there is potential for ML models to leverage digital footprints—such as social media activity, online surveys, and behavioral patterns—to predict mental health conditions like depression. However, while these advancements create new opportunities for mental health monitoring, the effectiveness of ML-based prediction largely depends on the quality of the underlying training data. [2] Real-world datasets often contain noise, inconsistencies, and mislabeled instances, making data preprocessing a critical step in predictive modeling. Prior research highlights that data cleaning significantly influences model generalization [3], but an important question remains: How to clean data to improve model performance without removing informative data. Furthermore, the choice of machine learning model plays a key role in handling such variations in data quality. We evaluate multiple classification models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—under different data preprocessing conditions to assess how cleaning affects their performance. By analyzing these models, we aim to provide insights into the relationship between data preprocessing, model robustness, and classification accuracy in mental health prediction.The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section II discusses related work on data preprocessing and model selection. Section III details our methodology, including data sources, preprocessing steps, and model training. Section IV presents experimental results and analysis.

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Bus passenger flow prediction integrates data analytics and modelling techniques to forecast the number of passengers using bus services, incorporating historical usage patterns, demographics, weather, and events for optimal scheduling and resource allocation. The Bi-LSTM fusion model enhances accuracy by processing past and future features simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional LSTM layers and an attention mechanism to capture temporal dependencies. This approach not only refines insights crucial for urban mobility challenges like traffic management and demand forecasting but also improves route planning and service efficiency. The SMO algorithm initializes with a diverse spider monkey population exploring solution spaces. Through local and global leader phases, it iteratively updates positions based on fitness and probabilistic selections, maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. Perturbation-based updates in the local leader phase ensure adaptability, preventing premature convergence, while the global leader phase guides towards better solutions, enhancing efficiency in complex optimization tasks and promoting dynamic adaptation. In Dataset 1, the proposed model achieved a training time of 137 seconds, slightly longer than HA (115s), SARIMA (112s), GRU (123s), and ST-ResNet (113s). It demonstrated superior accuracy at 89%, surpassing HA (66%), SARIMA (68%), GRU (63%), DeepST (78%), and ST-ResNet (84%). In Dataset 2, the model exhibited the lowest RMSE, MAE, and MAPE%, indicating superior predictive accuracy over SVR, CNN, GCN, LSTM, and CONV LSTM models. These findings validate the proposed model's effectiveness in enhancing predictive capabilities for transit forecasting, underscoring its potential to optimize urban mobility and transportation management strategies significantly.</jats:p>",

In this work the conceptual design of a Major Depression Remote Intelligent Monitor, called MADRIM is presented. The main goal of MADRIM is to follow the evolution of the patient during his/her recovery in order to understand its behavior and to support preventing the reoccurrence of depression. In this paper one of MADRIM's main modules, i.e. the Patient Evolution Model (PEM), is described in detail. The PEM, based on qualitative reasoning, studies the tendency in the depression level change of each patient. MADRIM is based on different input sources such are clinical data, life events and patient's mood as well as physiological data collected from sensors. As output the system provides three different levels of patient's enhancement information, i.e. progress information, alerts and alarms, to the different actors involved in the treatment, i.e. patients, primary care physicians, psychiatrists and virtual assistants.</jats:p>",

Prediction of CVD is essential for early detection and diagnosis, which is however compounded by the complex interplay between medical history, physical examination outcomes, and imaging results. While the existing automated systems are fraught with the usage of irrelevant and redundant attributes, artificial intelligence (AI) helps in the identification of potential CVD populations by prediction models. This work aims at developing an AI model for predicting CVD using different classifications of machine learning techniques. The CVD dataset was obtained from the UCI repository containing about 76 cardiac attributes for training in various machine learning models, which include a hybrid of artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA), artificial neural network, support vector machine (SVM), K-means, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT). The performance of the models was measured in terms of accuracy, means square error, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The results showed that the hybrid model of ANN-GA performs better with an accuracy of 86.4%, compared to the SVM, K-means, KNN, and DT measured at 84.0%, 59.6%, 79.0%, and 77.8%, respectively. It was observed that the system performs better as the number of datasets increases in the database, with a fewer selection of attributes using genetic algorithm for selection. Thus, the ANN-GA model is recommended for CVD prediction and diagnosis.</jats:p>",

The objective: to develop a perinatal pathology forecasting model using an artificial neural network (ANN) with the study of intergenic associations of the investigated and to analyze the working information technology to prevent the development of pathology. Materials and methods. Correlation analysis was conducted between multifactorial indicators along with genetic parameters of both the mother and the child, which influence the development of perinatal pathology. Calculations were performed using the package MedCalc® Statistical Software (v.22.009). A multi-sphere perceptron was chosen for mathematical modeling of the influence of genetic factors on the development of perinatal pathology. To calculate the weight coefficients of neurons, the method of inverse error propagation was chosen, the predictive accuracy of which is 90%. Results. During the study the structure and algorithms of the ANN were analyzed, the significant influence of genetic portraits of the mother and the child on the development of perinatal pathology compared to other factors was determined. It has been shown that the learning of ANN directly depends on the initial weighting coefficients and thresholds. It is proven that the method can estimate the degree of prognostic significance and the interaction of new factors with the available set. This distinguishes it from traditional statistical methods. The results of the research confirmed that the preparation of input and output data should be carried out by the method of scaling to bring the data into the acceptable range. It is emphasized that the use of ANN in medicine contributes to the automation of analysis, the processing of large clinical data volumes, and the minimization of the risk of errors. Conclusions. The main feature of ANN, which are actively used in genomic research, is its fast learning ability, convergence to the optimal solution when increasing the number of objects, and their efficiency when working with variable data. Prognosing perinatal pathology with the help of ANN with the study of intergenic associations improves the approach to providing medical care to newborns and ensures the prevention of development of long-term outcomes in the future life of the child. The proposed method of prognosis can be used in the development of methodological approaches to the creation of the State program of genetic screening among the population in Ukraine.</jats:p>",

Unlike relying solely on criteria such as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) or coefficient of determination (r2), this study advocates for the use of MAD/range as a more robust metric for prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with data exhibiting substantial order.The study sets the speed limit and traffic value at 0.65 and 0.88, respectively. Notably, both criteria yield identical accuracy results of 13% for MAD/R in predicting speed and 14% for traffic.

It generated unique texts, both for the same user and different users. The errors were student-like; therefore, ChatGPT-3.5 could be useful, both for ethical and unethical purposes. An Artificial Intelligence Adoption Prediction Tool (AIAPT) was designed to complement the AIAPM to calculate the Adoption Prediction Score (APS). Based on the results, all factors of the AIAPM can drive the adoption of ChatGPT-3.5 in English poetry classrooms; therefore, practical strategies are suggested to promote the responsible use of this AI-tool in English poetry classrooms.</p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Desert locusts are known as the world&amp;#8217;s most destructive migratory pest. In the context of the European project EO4EU and European Space Agency (ESA) project IDEAS, a service has been developed, divided in two parts: a first part as early warning to monitor suitable ecosystem for locust to breed, a second part as impact assessment simulating the evolution of swarms.The first part aims at predicting favorable breeding grounds for desert locusts seven days in advance by checking environmental conditions of the previous fifty days. Used environmental variables are Soil water content, Precipitation, and Temperature from ERA-5 land (Copernicus Climate). Additionally, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from MODIS plays a role in the prediction. Locust information for model training was taken from a presence-only dataset provided by FAO&amp;#8217;s Locust Watch. Actual most effective model is a customized version of Maxent. The latter is a statistical model widely used by researchers for species distribution modeling (SDM) as it is designed to work with presence-only datasets. Our model keeps Maxent's principles modifying the internal structure replacing the linear machine learning model with a Gated recurrent unit (GRU). This enables the model learning complex patterns and better understand the temporal evolution of features. Input data are time series where every time-step is a 5-day average of the above mentioned environmental variables, 50 days into 10 time steps. Data have been split into train and validation sets by using as training locust findings from 2000 to 2019 and as&amp;#160; validation findings from 2020 to 2021. Since no locust absence information is provided, only two evaluation techniques are used: recall, which reaches 76%, and positively predicted area which is at ~17%.The second part aims at evaluating the geographic footprint that adult locusts will have within a two-week time frame. The focus is on forecasting migration patterns, as locusts are able to travel long distances in short periods and explore new areas unpredictably.&amp;#160;The strength of this model lies in its stochastic structure since it simulates an environmental-biased random walk on a 2D lattice, generating batches of diverse potential scenarios. This approach incorporates complex driving-factors for migrations and considers all various paths that swarms may take.&amp;#160;Another strength is the ability to account for environmental conditions throughout the entire lifespan of desert locusts, enabling the prediction of future movements while also considering past ones. The model takes as input temperature and wind data while all the parameters and assumptions about the locust biology are taken from the FAO &amp;#8220;Desert Locust Guidelines: Biology and Behavior&amp;#8221;. Collecting environmental variables is essential, as they not only trigger migration events but also determine the direction and speed of swarm movement. Finally, the model produces output maps that estimate the probabilities of future appearance of swarms and their potential sizes.Predicted results for both parts are showing promising correlation with FAO reports on desert locust activity, additionally ground verification are on-going in order to test the performance of the model.</jats:p>",

Most studies depend on one-dimensional raw data and required fine feature extraction. To solve this problem, in the EEG visualization research field, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet, and coherence commonly used as method s for transferring EEG data to 2D images. However, we devised a new way from the concept that EEG’s asymmetry was considered one of the major biomarkers of depression. This study proposes a deep-asymmetry methodology that converts the EEG’s asymmetry feature into a matrix image and uses it as input to a convolutional neural network. The asymmetry matrix image in the alpha band achieved 98.85% accuracy and outperformed most of the methods presented in previous studies. This study indicates that the proposed method can be an effective tool for pre-screening major depressive disorder patients.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of a deep CNN to detect students with a diagnosis of specific learning disorder from their handwriting. The MobileNetV2 deep CNN architecture was used by applying transfer learning. The model was trained using a data set of 497 images of handwriting samples from students with a diagnosis of specific learning disorder, as well as those without this diagnosis. The detection of a specific learning disorder yielded on the validation set a mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.89.

    "abstract_findings": "<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by differences in communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection of ASD can significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions, thereby reducing challenges in later life. Nonetheless, diagnosing ASD can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting researchers and healthcare professionals to explore automated screening and diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive data-driven approach to ASD screening using a publicly available dataset of 704 adult participants. We examine and compare six different modeling techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep Dense Neural Networks (DDNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By optimizing hyperparameters and carefully preprocessing the data, we achieve a 100% accuracy on the hold-out test set using SVM and XGBoost, and above 98% accuracy with all deep learning models. We discuss the methodological framework, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, encoding, scaling, and model evaluation. We also present significant insights from the machine learning pipeline and highlight implications for future research in the domain of ASD screening. Our results underscore the feasibility of leveraging modern computational approaches to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and resource prioritization for ASD.</p>",

We also build a model to detect whether the speaker is depressed or not using LSTM in the final layer. This study suggests the possibility of increasing access to mental illness diagnosis by enabling patients to detect depression on their own in daily conversations. If the model proposed in this study is developed and the voice conversation system is connected, it will be easier for patients who cannot visit the hospital periodically or who are reluctant to visit the hospital to check their condition and seek recovery. Furthermore, it can be expanded to multi-label classification for various mental diseases and used as a simple self-mental disease diagnosis tool.</jats:p>",

Leveraging a dataset comprising 2,000 participants, enriched with demographic, socio-economic, behavioral, and clinical variables, including pre- and post-treatment Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration of factors influencing depression outcomes. Through meticulous data collection, we harmonized diverse variables ranging from basic demographic details to intricate clinical outcomes, paired with a rigorous feature selection process employing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analytical journey was underpinned by a robust hyper parameter tuning phase, ensuring the optimization of each model's predictive capacity. The study's core contribution lies in its exhaustive comparison of standalone ML and DL models against our crafted hybrid AI models, revealing a marked superiority of the latter in predicting depression with unparalleled accuracy. The hybrid models, through their synergetic integration of ML and DL methodologies, demonstrated a profound ability to navigate the complexity of depression's multifactorial nature, achieving a perfect prediction accuracy rate in our tests. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics for depression, underscoring the potential of hybrid AI models in transcending the limitations of traditional standalone approaches. This research not only paves the way for more nuanced and effective predictive tools in mental health care but also sets a benchmark for future studies at the intersection of biology, psychology, and artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are vast, offering a beacon of hope for personalized and preemptive mental health interventions.</jats:p>",

However, data availability on social media is often limited due to privacy concerns, even though deep learning models benefit from having more data to analyze. To address this issue, this study proposes a methodological framework system for clinical decision support that uses federated deep learning (FDL) to identify individuals experiencing depression and provide intervention decisions for clinicians. The proposed framework involves evaluation of datasets from three social media platforms, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. The study aims to provide a personalized clinical decision support system with evolvable features that can deliver precise solutions and assist healthcare professionals in medical diagnosis.

The assessment was carried out using six different target proteins using randomly chosen small molecules from the ZINC15 database for training. This new architecture proved to be more efficient in screening molecules that less favorably bind to specific targets and retaining molecules that favorably bind to it. Scientific contribution We have developed a new neural fingerprint-based screening model that has a significant ability to capture hits. Despite using a smaller dataset, this model is capable of mapping chemical space similar to other contemporary algorithms designed for molecular screening. The novelty of the present algorithm lies in the speed with which the models are trained and tuned before testing its predictive capabilities and hence is a significant step forward in the field of machine learning-embedded computational drug discovery.</p>",

A transformer-based architecture was trained to differentiate between the two classes, achieving the best performance to date. Additionally, we built a neural network model for predicting the potency of umami compounds, the first effort of its kind. These two models, in conjunction with similarity analysis and toxicity screening, form an end-to-end framework for the rational discovery of novel tastants.

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Radiographs are the most common imaging tool for identifying spinal lesions. The detection of these lesions can be challenging for radiologists. This work details the development and evaluation of a deep learning framework, named HealNNet-Lesions, for the detection of spinal lesions. It also explores the use of artificial intelligence and deep learning to potentially serve as an alternative for diagnosis and initial screening of specific findings in radiology instead of expensive and less accessible Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans with more affordable and accessible X-ray scans, particularly in rural and sub-urban India and other low-middle income countries (LMICs). A training dataset was constructed using 4502 Spine X-ray images from the VinDr-SpineXR Dataset. This dataset included findings in eight categories, six of which were unique spinal lesions, along with \"Other Lesions\" and \"No Finding\" categories. Using this dataset, a deep learning classifier was trained to determine if a spine scan was abnormal or normal, and a detector, named HealNNet-Lesions, was also trained to localize the lesions. The classifier was evaluated on a test dataset of 468 X-ray scans and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.84% and an accuracy of 71.37% for the image classification task. For lesion detection, HealNNet-Lesion achieved a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 43.73%. Since spinal lesions often require MRI and CT scans for their diagnosis, this framework demonstrates how deep learning can reduce the need for these expensive and less accessible imaging methods by supporting clinical decision-making where MRI/CT are unavailable with an X-Ray. These results establish a benchmark and serve as a proof of concept to encourage future research in this area.</jats:p>",

The cancer cell lines are well characterized by multiomics screening in CCLE and DepMap, enabling the application of AI and machine learning techniques to study the association between drug sensitivity and the underlying molecular profiles. The large scale and variety of data modalities enabled us to build an interpretable deep learning framework, INSIGHT, integrating the multiomics data and the drug’s molecular structure to predict drug response. We trained our model on the PRISM screen for single treatments and on the DrugComb screen database for combination treatments. Our method enables the in-silico extension of current screens by predicting drug response in cancer cell lines not included in the screen, as well as the drug response to novel single agent or combination therapy by leveraging the drug’s molecular structure.</jats:p><jats:p>Furthermore, the deep learning framework was built to enable biological interpretation. The connections between the hidden layers of the neural network incorporate prior biological knowledge such as signaling pathways.

While substantial efforts have been directed toward understanding spontaneous peptide self-assembly, redox-responsive sequences remain elusive and difficult to characterize.

This study explores the potential of AI-assisted generative art as a complementary tool for assessing depression risk. A sample of 230 participants (Mage = 21.54 years) used Midjourney, a text-to-image software, to create images of themselves using natural language prompts. Depression risk was measured using the 9-item Beck Depression Inventory, and prompt sentiment was analyzed with a pretrained RoBERTa model. Multiple significant correlations of moderate strength were identified, with negative sentiment emerging as the strongest predictor of depression scores. A random forest classifier achieved 80% sensitivity (AUC = 0.83) in identifying high-risk individuals, with even stronger metrics observed under a stricter cutoff criterion, though this introduces methodological challenges related to class imbalance. These findings suggest that cognitive and emotional biases associated with depression can influence self-expression in generative art, highlighting its potential for capturing depressive symptoms and advancing machine-learning-based screening algorithms in the future.</p>",

In this framework, data from different medical institutions do not require centralized storage but instead achieve cross-institutional collaborative optimization through local model training and secure parameter aggregation, thereby improving model performance under conditions of compliance and privacy protection. A multimodal feature fusion mechanism is introduced to jointly model structured diagnostic information, clinical text, and time-series data, enabling the capture of complex semantic associations and temporal relationships across modalities. At the output stage, the model adopts a probabilistic prediction strategy optimized with cross-entropy loss, which effectively enhances the accuracy and stability of risk identification. Experiments conducted on a public electronic health record dataset show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, achieving a good balance between privacy protection and predictive robustness. Overall, this study establishes an integrated framework that combines federated learning with multimodal modeling, providing a feasible path for the efficient use of electronic health records and health risk prediction, while demonstrating significant advantages in improving the value of medical data and supporting better health management decisions.</jats:p>",

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and patient data applied towards early prediction of PCa may lead to earlier interventions and increased survival. We have developed machine learning models to predict PCa risk in men 55 and under using PRSs combined with patient data. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on 91,106 male patients aged 35 to 55 using the UK Biobank database. Five gradient boosting models were developed and validated utilizing routine screening data, PRSs, additional clinical data, or combinations of the three. Results Combinations of PRSs and patient data outperformed models that utilized PRS or patient data only, and the highest performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.788. Our models demonstrated a substantially lower false positive rate (35.4%) in comparison to standard screening using prostate specific antigen (60–67%). Conclusion This study provides the first preliminary evidence for the use of PRSs with patient data in a machine learning algorithm for PCa risk prediction in men 55 and under for whom screening is not standard practice.</jats:p>",

When dealing with multi-modal data, missing values, and explainability, traditional methods may be somewhat problematic. This study proposes a cutting-edge AI-driven framework for cancer prediction by integrating structured EHRs, clinical notes, and genetic data. To analyze sequential data, this work uses deep learning (DL) models like Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers; to glean insights from medical texts that aren't organized, also use Natural Language Processing (NLP). The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is used to handle missing data, and to certify transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods are engaged to explain predictions. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is higher than that of conventional machine learning methods. It recovers clinical decision-making and early cancer diagnosis by integrating many data modalities. This study work emphasizes the importance of AI in practical healthcare settings.</jats:p>",

Not only do EHR data contain unprecedented access to dense, granular clinical data, additionally, since they derive directly from clinical health systems, EHR data provide a means to implement the models into clinical work flows as clinical decision support tools. While appealing, EHR data can be challenging to new users because they are not collected for research purposes. In this article, we discuss five considerations that statisticians ought to be aware of when developing risk prediction models for the purposes of implementation. These are designing the analysis, setting up the data, estimating the model, evaluating the model, and implementing and maintaining the model. While the primary statistical consideration of model estimation is familiar to most statisticians, many of these other considerations are more epidemiologic and informatics based in nature. For these reasons, we conclude that along with a clinical collaborator, the development and implementation of clinical risk models ultimately require team science.</jats:p>",

Predictive modeling, which aims at building computational models for predicting clinical risk, is a popular research topic in healthcare analytics. However, concerns about privacy of healthcare data may hinder the development of effective predictive models that are generalizable because this often requires rich diverse data from multiple clinical institutions. Recently, federated learning (FL) has demonstrated promise in addressing this concern. However, data heterogeneity from different local participating sites may affect prediction performance. Exploring such heterogeneity of data sources would aid in building accurate risk prediction models in FL. Due to acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis’ high prevalence among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), the early prediction of these conditions based on AI is an important topic in critical care medicine. In this study, we take AKI and sepsis onset risk prediction in ICU as two examples to explore the impact of data heterogeneity in the FL framework for risk prediction using EHR data across multiple hospitals. In particular, we built predictive models based on local, pooled, and FL frameworks. The local framework only used data from each site itself. The pooled framework combined data from all sites. In the FL framework, each local site did not have access to other sites’ data. A model was trained locally and its parameters were shared to a central aggregator, which was used to update the federated model’s weights and then subsequently, shared with each site. We found models built within a FL framework outperformed local counterparts. Then, we analyzed variable importance discrepancies across sites and frameworks. Finally, we explored potential sources of the heterogeneity within the EHR data. The different distributions of demographic profiles, medication use, and site information contributed to data heterogeneity.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Author Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The availability of a large amount of healthcare data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and advances of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provides opportunities to build predictive models for disease risk prediction. Due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, it is challenging to collect the data together from different hospitals and train a unified model on the combined data. Recent federated learning (FL) demonstrates promise in addressing the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. However, data heterogeneity in the FL framework may influence prediction performance.

EHRs are hosted on computers either locally (in the practice office) or remotely. Remote EHR systems are described as “cloud-based” or “internet-based. With over 75% of office-based clinicians and 96% of hospitals in the United States using an EHR system, nearly all practices have an immediate, practical interest in improving the efficiency and use of their EHRs. Some practices may be considering a replacement acquisition of an EHR to better care for their patients and reduce the burden on clinicians who need to use the EHR. One of the essential features of EHRs is their ability to be shared and accessed securely by different healthcare providers across various healthcare settings. This sharing of information enhances care coordination and improves communication among different medical teams involved in a patient's treatment.</jats:p>",

We also found that fine-tuning the baseline BART model with other setups caused different degrees of improvement (up to 80% relative improvement).

The aim of this review is to summarize existing literature in which machine learning (ML) methods have been used in combination with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for prediction of depression. Methods Systematic literature searches were conducted within arXiv, PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct, SCOPUS and Web of Science electronic databases. Searches were restricted to information published after 2010 (from 1st January 2011 onwards) and were updated prior to the final synthesis of data (27th January 2022). Results Following the PRISMA process, the initial 744 studies were reduced to 19 eligible for detailed evaluation. Data extraction identified machine learning methods used, types of predictors used, the definition of depression, classification performance achieved, sample size, and benchmarks used. Area Under the Curve (AUC) values more than 0.9 were claimed, though the average was around 0.8. Regression methods proved as effective as more developed machine learning techniques. Limitations The categorization, definition, and identification of the numbers of predictors used within models was sometimes difficult to establish, Studies were largely Western Educated Industrialised, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) in demography. Conclusion This review supports the potential use of machine learning techniques with EHRs for the prediction of depression. All the selected studies used clinically based, though sometimes broad, definitions of depression as their classification criteria. The reported performance of the studies was comparable to or even better than that found in primary care. There are concerns over the generalizability and interpretability.</jats:p>",

The information contained in the electronic health records (EHRs) can use in different areas such as risk prediction, estimation of treatment effect ect. Many prediction models using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can be used in risk assessment have been developed. The aim of this study is to bring together the researches on prediction models developed with AI technologies using the EHRs of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate them in terms of risk management in healthcare. Methods: The study restricted the search to the Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Medline databases to retrieve research articles published in English in 2010 and after. Studies with a prediction model using data obtained from EHRs in the ICU are included. The study focused solely on research conducted in ICU to predict a health condition that poses a significant risk to patient safety using artificial intellegence (AI) technologies. Results: Recognized prediction subcategories were mortality (n=6), sepsis (n=4), pressure ulcer (n=4), acute kidney injury (n=3), and other areas (n=10). It has been found that EHR-based prediction models are good risk management and decision support tools and adoption of such models in ICUs may reduce the prevalence of adverse conditions. Conclusions: The article results remarks that developed models was found to have higher performance and better selectivity than previously developed risk models, so they are better at predicting risks and serious adverse events in ICU. It is recommended to use AI based prediction models developed using EHRs in risk management studies. Future work is still needed to researches to predict different health conditions risks.</jats:p>",

Much research and development efforts have focused on using deep learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of illnesses from EHR in recent years. When it comes to risk prediction, deep learning-based techniques outperform more conventional machine learning models. But nothing in the literature fully accounts for what doctors already know, such as the connections between illnesses and their risk factors. This research examines the use of Multi-layer Perceptron models for the categorisation of diagnoses in electronic health records. The raw data and a modified version of the EHR dataset are used to train two MLPs with distinct topologies. For comparative purposes, a Random Forest is used as a baseline. To phenotype patients using their electronic health records, we provide a deep learning method. Predictive modelling of chronic illnesses is the particular scenario used to verify the suggested model on a real-world EHR data warehouse. Many deep learning applications on EHRs have been effective, and there is still a lot of potential to be realised. It has been discovered that deep learning models can learn from the limited EHR dataset, but not to a level where they outperform the baseline model.</jats:p>",

Due to the lack of detailed documentation and labor intensiveness of manual annotation, it is often only feasible to ascertain for a small subset the current status of the disease by a follow‐up time rather than the exact time. In this paper, we aim to develop risk prediction models for the onset time efficiently leveraging both a small number of labels on the current status and a large number of unlabeled observations on imperfect proxies. Under a semiparametric transformation model for onset and a highly flexible measurement error model for proxy onset time, we propose the semisupervised risk prediction method by combining information from proxies and limited labels efficiently. From an initially estimator solely based on the labeled subset, we perform a one‐step correction with the full data augmenting against a mean zero rank correlation score derived from the proxies. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed semisupervised estimator and provide a resampling procedure for interval estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimator performs well in a finite sample. We illustrate the proposed estimator by developing a genetic risk prediction model for obesity using data from Mass General Brigham Healthcare Biobank.</jats:p>",

However, traditional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods rely on simplified phenotype definitions or predefined trait sets, limiting their ability to represent the intricate phenotypic structures embedded within EHRs. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework, EEPRS, that leverages phenotype embeddings derived from EHRs to improve genetic risk prediction using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, enabling accurate, robust and interpretable risk prediction for a wide range of diseases. Employing embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GPT, we conducted EHR embedding-based GWAS and identified a distinct cardiovascular cluster via hierarchical clustering of genetic correlations. Across 41 clinical traits in the UK Biobank, our EEPRS framework consistently outperformed traditional single-trait PRS, particularly within this identified cluster. Validation using PRS-based phenome-wide association studies (PRS-PheWAS) further confirmed robust associations between EHR embedding-based PRS and circulatory system diseases. Furthermore, our data-adaptive method, EEPRS_optimal, employing cross-validation to select the best embedding method, leading to additional improvements in prediction.

    "abstract_findings": "With more than 2.1 million new cases of diagnosis each year, breast cancer is considered to be the most prevalent women disease. Within 10 years, nearly 30% patients who got cured at early-stages experienced cancer recurrence. Recurrence is a crucial aspect of breast cancer behaviour that is inseparably linked to mortality. Despite its importance, the significant proportion of breast cancer datasets rarely include it, which makes research into its prediction more challenging. It is still difficult to predict who will experience a recurrence and who won't, which has implications for the treatment that goes along with it. Clinicians treating breast cancer may be able to avoid ineffective overtreatment if Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are developed that can forecast the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence. This work proposes a novel automatic breast cancer recurrence classification and prediction system incorporating novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) algorithm. The proposed DCNN model is deployed on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for further evaluation. The role of AI in forecasting recurrence is examined in this work. The experimental results were analysed for various combination of train and validation dataset. The accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score for the proposed DCNN was calculated as 97.63 %, 98.57 %, 96.84 %, 97.89 % respectively.",

    "abstract_findings": "Introduction Real-time evaluations of the severity of depressive symptoms are of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are mainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly depends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning methods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most of the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however, in recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better prediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop a measurement of depression severity from expression and action features and to assess its validity among the patients with MDD. Methods We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which was based on the detection of patients’ facial expression and body movement from videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral depression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and action entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients. Results We found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This method presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes of BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results obtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales. Discussion The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients’ depression and its changing trend according to the patient’s expression and action features. Our model may provide an automatic auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD.",

However, the clinical prediction of PPH remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate an ideal machine learning-based prediction model for PPH in placenta previa parturients with cesarean section. METHODS The clinical data of 223 placenta previa parturients who underwent cesarean delivery in our hospital from 2016 to 2019 were retrospectively collected for analysis. An artificial neural network model was designed to predict PPH, defined as blood loss exceeding 1000 mL with 24h after delivery. Twenty clinical variables were selected as predictors. We also applied six conventional machine learning methods as reference models, including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, adaboost and logistic regression. All the models were validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall and the prediction accuracy of each model were reported. RESULTS A total of 223 pregnant women were enrolled in this study, including 101 cases (45.29%) experienced PPH. The proposed model achieved superior prediction performance with an AUC of 0.917, an accuracy of 0.851, a precision score of 0.829 and a recall score of 0.851, which outperformed other six conventional machine learning methods.

    "abstract_findings": "Introduction Postpartum depression (PPD) has numerous adverse impacts on the families of new mothers and society at large. Early identification and intervention are of great significance. Although there are many existing machine learning classifiers for PPD prediction, the requirements for high accuracy and the interpretability of models present new challenges. Methods This paper designs an ensemble neural network model for predicting PPD, which combines a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Neural Network with Dropout mechanism (DNN). The weights of FCNN and DNN in the proposed model are determined by their accuracies on the training set and respective Dropout values. The structure of the FCNN is simple and straightforward. The connection pattern among the neurons of the FCNN makes it easy to understand the relationship between the features and the target feature, endowing the proposed model with interpretability. Moreover, the proposed model does not directly rely on the Dropout mechanism to prevent overfitting. Its structure is more stable than that of the DNN, which weakens the negative impact of the Dropout mechanism on the interpretability of the proposed model. At the same time, the Dropout mechanism of the DNN reduces the overfitting risk of the proposed model and enhances its generalization ability, enabling the proposed model to better adapt to different clinical data. Results The proposed model achieved the following performance metrics on the PPD dataset: accuracy of 0.933, precision of 0.958, recall of 0.939, F1-score of 0.948, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.855, specificity of 0.923, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 0.889, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.077, and False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.061. Compared with 10 classic machine learning classifiers, under different dataset split ratios, the proposed model outperforms in terms of indicators such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and also has high stability. Discussion The research results show that the proposed model effectively improves the prediction performance of PPD, which can provide guiding suggestions for relevant medical staff and postpartum women in clinical decision-making. In the future, plans include collecting more disease datasets, using the proposed model to predict these diseases, and constructing an online disease prediction platform to embed the proposed model, which will help with real-time disease prediction.",

Purpose To evaluate the performance of a neural network (NN)-based model that combines the assessments of BD and an AI system in the prediction of risk of developing IC among women with negative screening mammography results. Materials and Methods This retrospective nested case-control study performed with screening examinations included women who developed IC and women with normal follow-up findings (from January 2011 to January 2015). An AI cancer detection system analyzed all studies yielding a score of 1-10, representing increasing likelihood of malignancy. BD was automatically computed using publicly available software. An NN model was trained by combining the AI score and BD using 10-fold cross-validation. Bootstrap analysis was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity at 90% specificity, and 95% CIs of the AI, BD, and NN models. Results A total of 2222 women with IC and 4661 women in the control group were included (mean age, 61 years; age range, 49-76 years). AUC of the NN model was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77,0.81), which was higher than AUC of the AI cancer detection system or BD alone (AUC, 0.73 [95% CI: 0.71, 0.76] and 0.69 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.71], respectively; P < .001 for both). At 90% specificity, the NN model had a sensitivity of 50.9% (339 of 666 women; 95% CI: 45.2, 56.3) for prediction of IC, which was higher than that of the AI system (37.5%; 250 of 666 women; 95% CI: 33.0, 43.7; P < .001) or BD percentage alone (22.4%; 149 of 666 women; 95% CI: 17.9, 28.5; P < .001).

We aimed to develop a novel approach, named the dual-branch convolutional neural network (DBNN), based on deep learning that uses ultrasound (US) images for the early prediction of NAC response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). This retrospective study included 114 women who were monitored with US during pretreatment (NAC pre) and after one cycle of NAC (NAC1). Pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no residual invasive carcinoma in the breast. For predicting pCR, the data were randomly split into a training set and test set (4:1). DBNN with US images was proposed to predict pCR early in breast cancer patients who received NAC. The connection between pretreatment data and data obtained after the first cycle of NAC was considered through the feature sharing of different branches. Moreover, the importance of data in various stages was emphasized by changing the weight of the two paths to classify those with pCR. The optimal model architecture of DBNN was determined by two ablation experiments. The diagnostic performance of DBNN for predicting pCR was compared with that of four methods from the latest research. To further validate the potential of DBNN in the early prediction of NAC response, the data from NAC pre and NAC1 were separately assessed. In the prediction of pCR, the highest diagnostic performance was obtained when combining the US image information of NAC pre and NAC1 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.939; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.907, 0.972; F1-score: 0.850; overall accuracy: 87.5%; sensitivity: 90.67%; and specificity: 85.67%), and the diagnostic performance with the combined data was superior to the performance when only NAC pre (AUC: 0.730; 95% CI: 0.657, 0.802; F1-score: 0.675; sensitivity: 76.00%; and specificity: 68.38%) or NAC1 (AUC: 0.739; 95% CI: 0.664, 0.813; F1-score: 0.611; sensitivity: 53.33%; and specificity: 86.32%) (p<0.01) was used.

In this paper, clinical data from PCOS patients and healthy control group were collected from ten hospitals containing 37 key indicators such as age, weight, BMI, menstrual cycle, etc. BP (Back Propagation) Neural Network prediction models were constructed and compared using the collected data and the cross-validation method was used for parameter tuning. It was found that BP N eural Network performed particularly well on the test set, and both demonstrated high prediction accuracy and generalization ability which provided strong evidence for the early identification and early valuable intervention opportunities for PCOS patients.",

    "abstract_findings": "The development and distribution of geologically complicated fault structure have the characteristics of uncertainty, randomness, ambiguity, and variability. Therefore, the prediction of complicated fault structures is a typical nonlinear problem. Neither fuzzy logic method nor artificial neural network alone can solve this problem well because the fuzzy method is generally not easy to realize adaptive learning function, and the neural network method is not suitable for describing sedimentary microfacies or geophysical facies. Therefore, taking the marginal subsags in the Jiyang Depression, Eastern China, as a study case, this paper uses the method of combining artificial neural network and fuzzy logic to study geologically complicated fault structure prediction model. This paper expounds on the research status and significance of geologically complicated fault structure prediction model, elaborates the development background, current status, and future challenges of artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic, introduces the method and principle of fuzzy neural network structure and fuzzy logic analysis algorithm, conducts prediction model design and implementation based on fuzzy neural network, proposes the learning algorithm of fuzzy neural network, analyzes the programming realization of fuzzy neural network, constructs complicated fault structure prediction model based on the artificial neural network and fuzzy logic, performs the fuzzy logic system selection of complicated fault structure prediction model, carries out the artificial neural network structure design of complicated fault structure prediction model, compares the prediction effects of the geologically complicated fault structure model based on artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic, and finally discusses the system design and optimization of the prediction model for geologically complicated fault structures. The study results show that the fuzzy neural network fully integrates the advantages of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic system; based on the clear physical background of fuzzy logic system, it effectively integrates powerful knowledge expression ability and fuzzy reasoning ability into the network knowledge structure of neural network, which greatly improves the prediction accuracy of geologically complicated fault structure.",

    "abstract_findings": "Since entering the new century, people’s living standards have steadily improved, and their living conditions have also continuously improved. The improvement in living standards has brought greater pressure to people. The recognition of emotion and psychological state has become one of the research hotspots. Because of excessive work pressure, many students now suffer from depression. In this paper, we use a large number of research data and comparative charts to facilitate the analysis of the collected data. At the same time, we use LDA topic classification and NLDA neural network algorithm for refining and concise data processing. The research shows that students’ psychological state will affect their academic achievements. Students should try their best to manage their mental state, learn to know their emotional state, and ensure a good mental state. Emotional leadership is very important for students’ physical and mental health. Emotional leadership is a very important task for students and schools. Schools and students should actively cooperate to improve ’students’ ability to manage emotions, especially their ability to self-regulate emotions, and to jointly help build a harmonious campus. Because of the contradiction between the complexity of interpersonal relationship and society and the simplicity of students, students are often frustrated in interpersonal communication. The biggest reason for students’ psychological state is that they have no courage to express themselves in public, cannot communicate with others, and are interested in and concerned about the failure of various activities.",

However, an accurate prediction is of importance for obstetricians as it helps to provide appropriate consultancy and determine the frequency of ultrasound examinations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in the prediction of spontaneous miscarriage risk through the analysis of early ultrasound gestational sac images. Methods A total of 2196 ultrasound images from 1098 women with early singleton pregnancies of gestational age between 6 and 8 weeks were used for training a CNN for the prediction of the miscarriage in the retrospective study. The patients who had positive fetal cardiac activity on their first ultrasound but then experienced a miscarriage were enrolled. The control group was randomly selected in the same database from the fetuses confirmed to be normal during follow-up. Diagnostic performance of the algorithm was validated and tested in two separate test sets of 136 patients with 272 images, respectively. Performance in prediction of the miscarriage was compared between the CNN and the manual measurement of ultrasound characteristics in the prospective study. Results The accuracy of the predictive model was 80.32% and 78.1% in the retrospective and prospective study, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for classification was 0.857 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.793–0.922) in the retrospective study and 0.885 (95%CI, 0.846–0.925) in the prospective study, respectively. Correspondingly, the predictive power of the CNN was higher compared with manual ultrasound characteristics, for which the AUCs of the crown-rump length combined with fetal heart rate was 0.687 (95%CI, 0.587–0.775). Conclusions The CNN model showed high accuracy for predicting miscarriage through the analysis of early pregnancy ultrasound images and achieved better performance than that of manual measurement.",

Breast cancer, which predominantly concerns women (roughly 1% of cases include non-females), will impact one in eight women in their lifetime. Breast carcinoma, one of the deadliest malignancies, is the main cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Today, early diagnosis and prognosis are crucial to increase survival rates and finally bring them down. Cancer researchers have a number of difficulties when attempting to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors as well as when attempting to make judgments about mild and metastatic breast cancer. Research has turned its attention to machine learning techniques, which have been shown to be successful in the early identification and prognostication of breast cancer. In proposed article, we utilized eight machine learning techniques to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours. After getting the data, a performance assessment and comparison of these different classifiers is done. The foremost goal of this study is to detect and utilize machine learning to detect breast cancer and determine which method is more efficient in terms of confusion matrices, accuracy, and precision. The Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network have demonstrated superior performance than all other classifiers, with an accurate result of 98.08%.",

This study aims to predict anxiety and depression levels in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and consider future mental health treatment for patients. A sample of 60 pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Malang were involved and evaluated longitudinally every two weeks over 13 periods. In this study, we use the Generalized Neural Network Mixed Model (GNMM) to obtain better results in predicting anxiety and depression levels in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and compare the results with the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The flexibility of GLMM in modeling longitudinal data, and the power of neural network in performing a prediction makes GNMM a powerful tool for predicting longitudinal data. The result shows that neural network's prediction performance is better than the classical GLMM with a smaller MSPE and fairly accurate prediction. The MSPEs of the three compared models: 1-Layer GNMM, 2-Layer, and GLMM, respectively are 0.0067, 0.0075, 0.0321 for the anxiety levels, and 0.0071, 0.0002, and 0.0775 for the depression levels. Furthermore, future research needs to investigate the data with a larger sample size or high dimensional data with large network architectures to prove the robustness of GNMM.",

The aim of this study is to assess the performance measures of the model after a web-based implementation for the prediction of a healthy SLN in clinically N0 BC patients. This retrospective study was designed to validate the NILS prediction model for SLN status using preoperatively available clinicopathological and radiological data. The model results in an estimated probability of a healthy SLN for each study participant. Our primary endpoint is to report on the performance of the NILS prediction model to distinguish between healthy and metastatic SLNs (N0 vs. N+) and compare the observed and predicted event rates of benign SLNs. After validation, the prediction model may assist medical professionals and BC patients in shared decision making on omitting SLN biopsies in patients predicted to be node-negative by the NILS model.

Current early screening interventions, such as digital mammography (DM), are susceptible to high false-positives and false-negatives. This paper explores the potential of convolutional neural network (CNN), a form of artificial intelligence (AI), to support screening mammography with the aim to enhance accuracy in lesion detection, image classification and diagnostic prediction. Because the adoption of AI in cancer diagnosis is still in its infancy, the objective of this paper is to provide insight into the benefits and limitations of deep learning-based approaches to detect and diagnose cancer. An analysis of the implementation of CNN in AI-screening mammography models was conducted, using the SWOT strategic analysis tool. Internal strengths that improve the predictive accuracy of CNN include transfer learning and data augmentation, whereas the internal weaknesses include a lack of data standardisation and reproducibility. External opportunities consist of increased sensitivity in differentiating between microcalcifications and non-tumorous structures, improved predictive diagnosis and reduced workload. Nevertheless, integration within clinical settings must also consider the external threats of breaching patient privacy, automation biases and the role of clinical judgement.",

    "abstract_findings": "Background: Accurate assessment of a woman’s individualized breast cancer risk is necessary to inform shared decision-making regarding screening and risk-reducing strategies. Recently, deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown better predictive potential for breast cancer risk compared to mammographic density (MD). We evaluated whether combining clinical factors in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) model, including MD, with a novel CNN-based mammographic evaluation more accurately predicts breast cancer risk than the BCSC model alone in a cohort of racially/ethnically diverse women. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 23,552 women, age 35-74 years, who underwent screening mammography from 2014 to 2018 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. We extracted data from the electronic health record (EHR) on breast cancer risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, prior benign breast biopsy, first degree family history of breast cancer, and MD). From this cohort, we identified 206 women who developed breast cancer by linkage to the tumor registry. We calculated 5-year invasive breast cancer risk using the BCSC model. We applied CNN-based breast cancer risk model to full-field craniocaudal mammographic views of both breasts, with an output of a risk score (range, 0-1). We used logistic regression models with breast cancer status as the outcome and predictors including clinical factors only (BCSC model) or combined with CNN risk score (hybrid model). We compared the prediction performance of these models via area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) based on the DeLong test. We also calculated each model’s AUC for subgroups of age and race/ethnicity. Results: Among 23,552 evaluable women, mean age was 55.9 years (standard deviation [SD], 9.5) with 27% non-Hispanic White, 9% non-Hispanic Black, 36% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and 23% Other/Unknown race/ethnicity. Four percent had a first-degree family history of breast cancer, 10% had a prior benign breast biopsy, 45% had heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts on mammography, and 22% met high-risk criteria based upon a 5-year invasive breast cancer risk 1.67% according to the BCSC model. Mean CNN risk score was higher among breast cancer cases compared to unaffected controls (0.477 vs. 0.466, p=0.077). We found that the hybrid model outperformed the BCSC model (AUC of 0.676 vs. 0.640, respectively; p=0.003). In subgroup analyses, the hybrid model more accurately predicted breast cancer risk compared to the BCSC model among women age<50 (AUC of 0.713 vs. 0.645, respectively; p=0.078) and age>=50 (AUC of 0.663 vs. 0.625, respectively; p=0.026); non-Hispanic Black women (AUC of 0.794 vs. 0.663, respectively; p=0.028) and Hispanic women (AUC of 0.666 vs. 0.621, respectively; p=0.060). Conclusion: Among women undergoing screening mammography, a hybrid model incorporating a CNN-based mammography evaluation with clinical factors from the BCSC model more accurately predicted breast cancer risk relative to the BCSC model alone, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. Combined with clinical risk factors, our CNN model may be used to efficiently predict breast cancer risk and inform risk-stratified breast cancer screening and prevention strategies.

    "abstract_findings": "This study investigated the usefulness of deep learning-based automatic detection of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) effusion using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with temporomandibular disorder and whether the diagnostic accuracy of the model improved when patients’ clinical information was provided in addition to MRI images. The sagittal MR images of 2948 TMJs were collected from 1017 women and 457 men (mean age 37.19 ± 18.64 years). The TMJ effusion diagnostic performances of three convolutional neural networks (scratch, fine-tuning, and freeze schemes) were compared with those of human experts based on areas under the curve (AUCs) and diagnosis accuracies. The fine-tuning model with proton density (PD) images showed acceptable prediction performance (AUC = 0.7895), and the from-scratch (0.6193) and freeze (0.6149) models showed lower performances (p < 0.05). The fine-tuning model had excellent specificity compared to the human experts (87.25% vs. 58.17%). However, the human experts were superior in sensitivity (80.00% vs. 57.43%) (all p < 0.001). In gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualizations, the fine-tuning scheme focused more on effusion than on other structures of the TMJ, and the sparsity was higher than that of the from-scratch scheme (82.40% vs. 49.83%, p < 0.05). The Grad-CAM visualizations agreed with the model learned through important features in the TMJ area, particularly around the articular disc. Two fine-tuning models on PD and T2-weighted images showed that the diagnostic performance did not improve compared with using PD alone (p < 0.05). Diverse AUCs were observed across each group when the patients were divided according to age (0.7083–0.8375) and sex (male:0.7576, female:0.7083). The prediction accuracy of the ensemble model was higher than that of the human experts when all the data were used (74.21% vs. 67.71%, p < 0.05). A deep neural network (DNN) was developed to process multimodal data, including MRI and patient clinical data. Analysis of four age groups with the DNN model showed that the 41–60 age group had the best performance (AUC = 0.8258). The fine-tuning model and DNN were optimal for judging TMJ effusion and may be used to prevent true negative cases and aid in human diagnostic performance. Assistive automated diagnostic methods have the potential to increase clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy.",

If a stroke is not diagnosed correctly can lead to brain injury, paralysis or even death. As the symptoms of Stroke are very instantaneous and can be triggered by unforeseen conditions also, it makes prevention of this situation very difficult to predict. The pandemic has made this worse as depression is the next stage of it which can be seen by the suffering of the people all across the globe. In our paper, we have taken a step to highlight this important topic of discussion by using advanced Machine learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict any possibility of stroke. We have proposed our final model using Artificial Neural Network which gives the best roc score of 0.84 and given a comparative analysis of how well do other Machine Learning Algorithms like ensemble-based, tree-based and Naive Bayes-based Algorithms perform in predicting Stroke.",

The present study outlines a novel approach for analyzing breast cancer data by using the CatBoost classification model with a multi-layer perceptron neural network (CatBoost+MLP). Explainable artificial intelligence techniques are used to cohere with the proposed CatBoost with the MLP model. The proposed model aims to enhance the interpretability of predictions in breast cancer diagnosis by leveraging the benefits of CatBoost classification technique in feature identification and also contributing towards the interpretability of the decision model. The proposed CatBoost+MLP has been evaluated using the Shapley additive explanations values to analyze the feature significance in decision-making. Initially, the feature engineering is done using the analysis of variance technique to identify the significant features. The MLP model alone and the CatBoost+MLP model are being analyzed using divergent performance metrics, and the results obtained are compared with contemporary breast cancer identification techniques.",

Using questionnaires is an alternative to labor-intensive diagnostic interviews in a large general population, but previous models for predicting suicide attempts suffered from low sensitivity. We developed and validated a deep graph neural network model that increased the prediction sensitivity of suicide risk in young adults (n = 17,482 for training; n = 14,238 for testing) using multi-dimensional questionnaires and suicidal ideation within 2 weeks as the prediction target. The best model achieved a sensitivity of 76.3%, specificity of 83.4%, and an area under curve of 0.878 (95% confidence interval, 0.855–0.899). We demonstrated that multi-dimensional deep features covering depression, anxiety, resilience, self-esteem, and clinico-demographic information contribute to the prediction of suicidal ideation. Our model might be useful for the remote evaluation of suicide risk in the general population of young adults for specific situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract_findings": "Depression is a mental illness influenced by various factors, including stress in everyday life, physical activities, and physical diseases. It accompanies such symptoms as continuous depression, sleep disorder, and suicide attempts. In the healthcare, it is necessary to predict diverse situations accurately. Accordingly, in order to care for mental health, it is necessary to recognize individuals’ situations and continue to manage them. In the area of mental diseases and treatment, research has been conducted to find a patient’s state with the use of big data and to monitor the worst situation. Mental illnesses typically have depression. Research on Mental healthcare using artificial intelligence do conduct on prediction based on patients’ voice, word choice, and conversation length. However, there is not much research on situation prediction in order to prevent depression. Therefore, this study proposes the context-DNN model for predicting depression risk using multiple-regression. The context of the proposed context-DNN consists of the information to predict situations and environments influencing depression in consideration of context information. Each context information related to predictor variables of depression becomes an input of DNN, and variable for depression prediction becomes an output of DNN. For DNN connection, the regression analysis to predict the risk of depression is used so as to predict the potential context influencing the risk of depression. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed model was evaluated to have the best performance in regression analysis and comparative analysis with DNN.",

    "abstract_findings": "<title>Abstract</title> <p>Decades of preclinical research have implicated divergent roles of basal and task-based activity within the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways in the neurobiological mechanisms of depression. However, translation to humans has been limited by low-resolution neuroimaging methods during the inherent computational nature of learning processes. Here, utilizing high-resolution, precision multi-echo functional MRI, Bayesian modeling, and graph-theory network influence modeling, we demonstrate that relative to controls, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) are characterized by an elevated influence of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) within the mesolimbic/mesocortical network during task-free brain states. During task-based brain states, mesocortical hyperconnectivity was linked to blunted neural tracking of reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the nucleus accumbens and greater anhedonia, while blunted neural tracking of RPEs in the basolateral amygdala was linked with greater anxiety. Thus, mesocortical hyperconnectivity in MDD may lead to a computationally underutilized learning mechanism that impacts discrete depression and anxiety symptom domains. Together these results may explain paradoxical preclinical work and elucidate neural underpinnings for the clinical heterogeneity of depression.</p>",

The study utilized a cross-sectional design. Vascular endothelial function was assessed non-invasively using Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD). Pulse wave characteristics were quantified using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, and motion-induced noise in the PPG signals was mitigated through the application of a recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive filtering algorithm. A fixed-load cycling exercise protocol was employed. A TCN was constructed to classify flow-mediated dilation (FMD) into “optimal”, “impaired”, and “at risk” levels; (3) Results: TCN achieved an average accuracy of 79.3%, 84.8%, and 83.2% in predicting FMD at the “optimal”, “impaired”, and “at risk” levels, respectively. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparison demonstrated that the accuracy of the TCN in predicting FMD at the impaired and at-risk levels was significantly higher than that of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest algorithms; (4) Conclusions: The use of pulse wave data during exercise combined with the TCN for predicting the vascular health status of elderly women demonstrated high accuracy, particularly in predicting impaired and at-risk FMD levels. This indicates that the integration of exercise pulse wave data with TCN can serve as an effective tool for the assessment and monitoring of the vascular health of elderly women.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Recent studies have revealed mutually correlated audio features in the voices of depressed patients. Thus, the voices of these patients can be characterized based on the combinatorial relationships among the audio features. To date, many deep learning–based methods have been proposed to predict the depression severity using audio data. However, existing methods have assumed that the individual audio features are independent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deep learning–based regression model that allows for the prediction of depression severity on the basis of the correlation among audio features. The proposed model was developed using a graph convolutional neural network. This model trains the voice characteristics using graph-structured data generated to express the correlation among audio features. We conducted prediction experiments on depression severity using the DAIC-WOZ dataset employed in several previous studies. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.15, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.25, and a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 50.96%. Notably, RMSE and MAE significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the-art prediction methods. From these results, we conclude that the proposed model can be a promising tool for depression diagnosis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Most protein molecules exist in a water medium and interact with numerous water molecules. Consideration of interactions between protein molecules and water molecules is essential to understanding the functions of the protein. In computational studies on protein functions, either implicit solvation or explicit solvation methods are used to consider the effect of water on the protein. Implicit solvation methods consider water as a continuous solvent and have lower computational costs than explicit methods that consider water as a collection of individual water molecules. However, some water molecules have specific interactions with protein molecules, which are critical to protein function and require explicit treatment to consider these specific interactions. Thus, as a compromise between computational cost and consideration of specific interactions, hybrid methods use explicit consideration of water molecules with specific interaction with protein molecules while considering other water molecules implicitly. Prediction of the water positions having specific interaction is required to perform such hybrid methods, where various water position prediction methods have been developed. However, currently developed water position prediction methods still require considerable computational cost. Here, we present a water position prediction method with low computational cost and state-of-the-art prediction performance by utilizing SE(3)-an equivariant graph neural network. The introduction of a graph neural network enabled the consideration of the atom as a single data point, which makes computational costs less than our previous water prediction method using a convolutional neural network, which considers an atom as multiple data points. Our new water position prediction method, WatGNN, showed an average computation time of 1.86 seconds while maintaining state-of-the-art prediction performance.

It is computational system inspired by the structure, processing method, and learning ability of a biological brain. According to bio-mechanics perspective, the neural system is utilized to check the non-direct connections between datasets. Also, ANN model in gait application is more desired than bio-mechanics strategies or statistical methods.

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Until recently, the statistical approach was the main technique in solving the prediction problem. In the framework of static models, the tasks of forecasting, the identification of hidden periodicity in data, analysis of dependencies, risk assessment in decision making, and others are solved. The general disadvantage of statistical models is the complexity of choosing the type of the model and selecting its parameters. Computing intelligence methods, among which artificial neural networks should be considered at first, can serve as alternative to statistical methods. The ability of the neural network to comprehensively process information follows from their ability to generalize and isolate hidden dependencies between input and output data. Significant advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning and generalizing the accumulated knowledge. The article proposes a method of neural networks training in solving the problem of prediction of the time series. Most of the predictive tasks of the time series are characterized by high levels of nonlinearity and non-stationary, noisiness, irregular trends, jumps, abnormal emissions. In these conditions, rigid statistical assumptions about the properties of the time series often limit the possibilities of classical forecasting methods. The alternative methods to statistical methods can be the methods of computational intelligence, which include artificial neural networks. The simulation results confirmed that the proposed method of training the neural network can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the time series.</jats:p>",

In the method, the network traffic data is fitted firstly by the cubic spline curve, and the fitted data is extracted according to different time granularities. Then, several GRU neural networks corresponding to specific time granularities are used for network traffic pre-prediction. Finally, the pre-prediction results of all the GRU neural networks are fed into the fully connected neural network. The fully connected neural network outputs the final network traffic prediction results. Comparison results show that the proposed method can improve the calculation accuracy by 9.0% and reduce the calculation time by 28.6%.</p>",

This paper mainly analyzed the problem of network security situation prediction (NSSP). The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network was improved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a modified PSO (MPSO)-RBF algorithm was obtained, which was used as the prediction model. Then, the data from National Internet Emergency Center (CNCERT/CC) were used as the experimental data, and the MPSO-RBF algorithm was compared with RBF and PSO-RBF algorithms. The results showed that the MPSO-RBF algorithm could achieve convergence in about 50 times of iterations, showing a high calculation efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value, mean square error (MSE) value, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) value were small, 2.13%, 0.0005, and 0.0224, respectively, showing that the algorithm had good prediction performance. The results verify the reliability of the MPSO-RBF algorithm in NSSP, which is conducive to further improve network security.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "Depression is a widespread mental health issue with profound global impact, often leading to diminished life quality and increased suicide risk. Despite available treatments, many depression cases go unnoticed and untreated. This underscores the necessity for a precise, personalized model to predict depression severity and individual risk factors, utilizing machine learning on comprehensive, multimodal datasets. While previous efforts employing machine learning (ML) to gauge depression severity exist, their effectiveness has been curtailed by small datasets and a lack of personalization. To address this gap, we propose an advanced ML-based approach for predicting depression severity and identifying personalized risk factors. ML enhances the precision of depression severity assessments, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and improves the identification of individual risk factors. In our study, we implemented, assessed, and compared five supervised ML algorithms-Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-known for their accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. We utilized a multimodal dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), encompassing demographic, dietary, socio-economic, lifestyle, medical, laboratory, and clinical data. The Random Forest algorithm proved to be the most effective, demonstrating an R-squared of 0.93, an explained variance score (EVS) of 0.93, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51, a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.73, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.32. It effectively pinpointed both general and personalized risk factors for depression severity. Our model not only proves effective in predicting depression severity and identifying personalized risk factors but also shows promise for clinical application in assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, and depression management.",

Here, we aim to detect mental effort on a verbal task, using automated voice analysis and machine learning. Methods Audio data from the digit span backwards task were recorded and scored with automated speech recognition using the online platform NeuroVocalixTM, yielding usable data from 2,764 healthy adults (1,022 male, 1,742 female; mean age 31.4 years). Acoustic features were aggregated across each trial and normalized within each subject. Cognitive load was dichotomized for each trial by categorizing trials at >0.6 of each participants' maximum span as “high load.” Data were divided into training (60%), test (20%), and validate (20%) datasets, each containing different participants. Training and test data were used in model building and hyper-parameter tuning. Five classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were trained to predict cognitive load (“high” vs. “low”) based on acoustic features. Analyses were limited to correct responses. The model was evaluated using the validation dataset, across all span lengths and within the subset of trials with a four-digit span. Classifier discriminant power was examined with Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis. Results Participants reached a mean span of 6.34 out of 8 items (SD = 1.38). The Gradient Boosting classifier provided the best performing model on test data (AUC = 0.98) and showed excellent discriminant power for cognitive load on the validation dataset, across all span lengths (AUC = 0.99), and for four-digit only utterances (AUC = 0.95). Discussion A sensitive biomarker of mental effort can be derived from vocal acoustic features in remotely administered verbal cognitive tests. The use-case of this biomarker for improving sensitivity of cognitive tests to subtle pathology now needs to be examined.",

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using deidentified data from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository. The study included 1,578 adult patients (≥18 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 while hospitalized, comprising 960 (60.8%) female patients with a mean (SD) age of 51.86 (18.49) years and 618 (39.2%) male patients with a mean (SD) age of 54.35 (18.48) years. Machine learning (ML) model training involved cross-validation to assess their performance in predicting patient disposition. Results We developed and validated six supervised ML-based prediction models (logistic regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine classifier) to predict patient discharge status. The models were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score. The random forest classifier exhibited the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.72. Logistic regression (accuracy: 0.85, AUC: 0.71), k-nearest neighbor (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.63), decision tree (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.61), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.66), and support vector machine classifier (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.67) also demonstrated valuable predictive capabilities. Significance This study’s findings are crucial for efficiently allocating healthcare resources during pandemics like COVID-19. By harnessing ML techniques and EHR data, we can create predictive tools to identify patients at greater risk of severe symptoms based on their medical histories. The models developed here serve as a foundation for expanding the toolkit available to healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, explainable ML methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations, aid in uncovering underlying data features that inform healthcare decision-making processes.",

    "abstract_findings": "The growth of cells in the ovaries is the cause of ovarian cancer. Healthy body tissue can be destroyed quickly by the cells, which can rapidly multiply. There are two ovaries in the female reproductive system, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs and the hormones estrogen and progesterone are produced by each of the almond-shaped ovaries. This work aims to perform predictive analytics for early diagnosis by combining statistical techniques and machine learning models with clinical data from 349 patients. The significant blood biomarkers are determined by applying the student’s t-test and the log fold changes of two groups in statistical analysis. In addition, a collection of machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), are used in the creation of classification models to differentiate between patients with malignant ovarian cancer and those with benign ovarian cancer. Serum samples of human epididymis protein 4, carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were found to be the most useful biomarkers using both methods. Additional general chemistry tests included neutrophil ratio, thrombocytosis, hematocrit, calcium, indirect bilirubin, uric acid, and atriums. Additionally, the predictive analysis results demonstrate that, up to 98 percent of the time, the machine learning models can correctly distinguish between patients with benign and malignant conditions. Machine learning detection has the potential to significantly aid in the diagnosis of cancer because early-stage detection is typically unavailable.",

It is important to note that suicidal ideation is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a single factor or mental disorder. According to reports, the primary components that go into suicide ideation are depression, anxiety, high levels of stress, unsatisfactory relationships, sleep disturbances, and physical or mental impairments. Therefore, it is essential to consider a holistic approach that considers multiple factors when predicting suicidal ideation. Our proposed work uses machine learning techniques to foresee suicide ideation utilizing a sizable example of review information. After collecting the data using a labelled dataset, we preprocessed and trained it on various machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). The results showed that among the calculated models LR gives the best result with 76% accuracy, followed by SVM (75%), MLP (74%), RF (74%), DT (74%).

Early diagnosis and interventions are critical to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Methods This prospective observational study analyzed clinical data from 270 patients (calculated using G*Power 3.1.9.7 analysis (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany), α = 0.05, power = 0.80), with 260 (96.3%) completing the protocol. The cohort comprised 149 (55.2%) males and 121 (44.8%) females, distributed across CKD (n=55, 21.2%), CLD (n=52, 20.0%), TB (n=51, 19.6%), dementia (n=50, 19.2%), and heart disease (n=52, 20.0%). Three ML models were employed with ChatGPT version 3.5 assistance (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) in feature selection and hyperparameter optimization: logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied to ensure robustness. Results The random forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest accuracy in predicting CKD (47/55, 85.3%, p < 0.001, sensitivity 45/55, 82.5%, specificity 48/55, 87.2%) and heart disease (46/52, 88.2%, p < 0.001, sensitivity 45/52, 85.7%, specificity 47/52, 90.1%). Logistic regression effectively predicted TB (41/51, 80.1%, p < 0.01) and dementia (41/50, 82.4%, p < 0.01). Key predictive parameters included hemoglobin (median 10.2 g/dL, IQR 8.4-12.6) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (median 42.0 mm/hr, IQR 20.0-65.0). Model validation showed high consistency, with positive acid-fast bacilli in 40/51 (78.4%) TB cases and characteristic radiological findings in 43/51 (84.3%) cases. Conclusion ML algorithms, particularly random forest, show promising potential in chronic disease classification and prediction. The integration of ChatGPT enhanced model development through optimized feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. Future research should focus on external validation through multi-center studies and prospective clinical trials.",

    "abstract_findings": "Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common surgery-requiring conditions of the spine in the aged population. As elderly patients often present with multiple comorbidities and limited physiological reserve, individualized risk assessment using comprehensive geriatric assessment is crucial for optimizing surgical outcomes. Patients 65 years or older who underwent elective surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis between June 2015 and December 2018 were prospectively enrolled, resulting in 261 eligible patients of age 72.3 ± 4.8 years (male 108, female 153). Twenty-seven experienced complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher within 30 days, and 79 received transfusion during hospital stay. The cohort was split into train-validation (n = 208) and test (n = 53) sets. A total of 48 features, including demographics, comorbidity, nutrition, and perioperative status, were collected. Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained using five-fold cross-validation. AUROC and AUPRC were considered the primary performance metrics, and the results were compared with those estimated with ACS-NSQIP scoring system. A set of Compact models incorporating a smaller number of features was also trained, and SHAP analysis was conducted to evaluate the models’ interpretability. The reduced number of features did not result in the drop of AUROC and AUPRC for all machine learning algorithms (P > 0.05). when compared to the ACS-NSQIP scoring system, which achieved a test AUROC of 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13–0.73) and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.10–0.36) on the first two tasks, the Compact model showed significantly greater AUROC values nearing or surpassing 0.90. Decision tree-based algorithms demonstrated larger test AUROC than logistic regression and generally agreed on the most influential features for each task. Advanced machine learning models have consistently shown greater performance and interpretability over conventional methodologies, implying their potential for a more individualized risk assessment of the aged population.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between 2018 and 2023 in the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of Balıkesir University Health Practice and Research Hospital. A dataset of 69 female patients between the ages of 23-67 years; for the prediction of HPV status 1 year after the conization operation, the patients' data were recorded according to the criteria we determined, and these data were analyzed and classified using machine learning methods. Various Machine Learning methods such as Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Catboost, Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) are used here. Results: We found the highest accuracy rate in Random Forest, and Catboost with 76 %. Gradient Boosting followed with a score of 67%, and Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) performed considerably lower, with scores of 48% and 43%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results show that machine learning, a novel use of artificial intelligence, is effective in predicting the persistence of high-risk HPV. Further studies with more data will be a promising and useful tool for HPV and cervical cancer screening in the future.",

Study Design A single‐center, retrospective, cohort study. Setting Sleep medical center. Methods All subjects with OSA who underwent velopharyngeal surgery followed for 3 to 6 months were enrolled in this study. Demographic, polysomnographic, and anatomical variables were analyzed. Compared with traditional stepwise linear regression (LR) algorithm, machine learning algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression, K‐nearest neighbor, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting were utilized to establish the regression model. Surgical success was defined as a ≥50% reduction in AHI to a final AHI of <20 events/h. Results A total of 152 OSA adult patients (median [interquartile range] age = 40 [35, 48] years, male/female = 136/16) were included in this study. The ANN model achieved the highest performance with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.23 ± 0.05, a root mean square error of AHI of 10.71 ± 1.01 events/h, an accuracy for outcomes classification of 81.3% ± 1.2% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 74.6% ± 1.9%, whereas for LR model, they were 0.094 ± 0.06, 11.61 ± 0.76 events/h, 71.7% ± 1.5% and 68.8% ± 2.9%, respectively. Conclusion The machine learning‐based model exhibited excellent performance for predicting postoperative AHI, which is helpful in guiding patient selections and improving surgery outcomes.",

The data were collected from 114 adolescents aged between 12 and 21 who were participating in a depression research study at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. They made up to 8 visits where a psychiatrist would assess their level of depression by conducting a Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) survey. Between visits, participants wore the GeneActiv wearable device to provide actigraphy data and also answered survey questions to provide EMA data. Any subject that experienced one visit with a CDRS score of less than 40 followed by another visit with a score of greater than 40 was labelled as undergoing a relapse event. Various ML methods including support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks in combination with fusion methods were used to predict relapse events. After training the above methods on 67% of the participants and testing them on the remaining ones, it was determined that feature fusion techniques applied to actigraphy and EMA metrics produced the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72. Another novel technique combining raw actigraphy counts with the aforementioned metrics yielded areas of up to 0.65. Overall, the results show that there is much promise that can be held in the integration of digital phenotypes for the prediction of relapse events in adolescents.",

Data were derived from the Chinese Psychological Health Guard Project (primary sample: n = 179,877; age 9–18) and China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (validation samples across age spans). We employed a two-stage machine learning approach: first applying Recursive Feature Elimination with multiple linear regression to identify core predictive items for total depression scores, followed by logistic regression for optimizing depression classification (CES-D ≥ 16). Model performance was systematically evaluated through discrimination (ROC analysis), calibration (Brier score), and clinical utility analyses (decision curve analysis), with additional validation using random forest and support vector machine algorithms across independent samples. The resulting stratified screening system consists of an initial four-item rapid screening layer (encompassing emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal dimensions) for detecting probable depression (AUC = 0.982, sensitivity = 0.945, specificity = 0.926), followed by an enhanced assessment layer with five additional items. Together, these nine items enable accurate prediction of the full CES-D-20 total score (R2 = 0.957). This stratified approach demonstrated robust generalizability across age groups (R2 > 0.94, accuracy > 0.91) and time points. Calibration analyses and decision curve analyses confirmed optimal clinical utility, particularly in the critical risk threshold range (0.3–0.6). This study contributes to the refinement of CES-D by developing a machine learning-derived stratified screening version, offering an efficient and reliable approach that optimizes assessment burden while maintaining excellent psychometric properties. The stratified design makes it particularly valuable for large-scale mental health screening programs, enabling efficient risk stratification and targeted assessment allocation.",

Understanding how diet and lifestyle influence these conditions is vital for targeted interventions. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) to identify key risk factors and improve mental health predictions in adult males. This cross-sectional study gathered dietary data from 400 adult males using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The dataset contained 59 predictor variables, and DAS was classified as either normal or indicative of some degree of disorder. The predictive performance of five ML models [bagging, boosting, Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)] was assessed using cross-validation. Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision (positive predictive value, PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate performance. DAS were present in 103 (25.47%) of participants. Bagging, boosting, and RF models outperformed others, achieving over 70% in all metrics. Key prognostic factors for predicting DAS include fried fast food, physical activity (PA), body mass index (BMI), magnesium, sodium, and other dietary elements like butter/margarine, fructose, and vitamin K. Chromium and caffeine were significant predictors of depression and anxiety, while cholesterol and olive oil were strongly associated with stress. The study shows that the RF, boosting, and bagging algorithms outperformed other models in predicting DAS across all evaluation criteria. Key dietary and lifestyle factors, such as magnesium, sodium, BMI, caffeine, and cholesterol, were identified as significant predictors, highlighting the potential of ML for advancing targeted mental health interventions. Practical Application: This study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression by analyzing dietary patterns, lifestyle choices, and clinical parameters. The results provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers in creating targeted dietary and lifestyle interventions to improve mental health outcomes. In addition, these findings have important implications for the food and nutrition industry, potentially guiding the development of specialized nutritional products aimed at enhancing mental well-being.",

This study aims to develop a gait-based depression recognition method for Chinese community-dwelling older adults. Ninety-two participants aged over 60 from Xiamen, China, were recruited for a three-week cross-sectional study. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, with a score of ≥ 10 indicating depression. From each group (depression and non-depression), twenty-five individuals were randomly selected for Kinect-based gait analysis. Gait data were recorded using a Microsoft Kinect in the indoor experimental area. χ2 and t-tests were used for statistical comparisons. Four machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and Random Forest were employed to develop predictive models for depression. SHapley Additive exPlanations were used to explain the feature importance. The average age was 64.1, and 72% were female, with the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 29.34%. Older adults with depressive symptoms exhibited significant gait abnormalities, including reduced body sway (P < 0.01, 95% CI (11.81, 81.79)), right-arm swing (P < 0.05, 95% CI (4.90, 85.07)), left step length (P < 0.05, 95% CI (5.43, 154.32)), right step length (P < 0.05, 95% CI (23.89, 171.36)), left step height (P < 0.001, 95% CI (100.42, 337.85)), walking speed (P < 0.001, 95% CI (245.79, 882.54)), step width (P < 0.05, 95% CI (3.46, 172.34)), and right stride length (P < 0.01, 95% CI (3.99, 25.18)). The Random Forest algorithm achieved the best performance (AUC-ROC = 0.911, Sensitivity = 0.857) in differentiating individuals with or without depressive symptoms based on discriminated spatiotemporal gait features. The five most important gait parameters in the optimal model were left step height, walking speed, right step height, body sway, and step width. Spatiotemporal gait features are associated with depressive symptoms in older adults. The developed machine learning models with high predictive accuracy, suggest the potential of Kinect-based gait assessment as a real-time and cost-effective screening tool for older adults with depressive symptoms.",

Studying the effect of mental health problems on cognitive development has gained researchers' attention for the last two decades OBJECTIVE In this paper, we seek to use machine learning techniques to predict the risk factors associated with school children's depression and anxiety METHODS The study data consisted of 5685 students in grades 5-9, aged 10-17 years, studying at public and refugee schools in the West Bank. The data were collected using the health behaviors school children questionnaire in the 2012-2013 academic year and analyzed using machine learning to predict the risk factors associated with student mental health symptoms. Five machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes) were used for the prediction. RESULTS The results indicated that the Random Forest model had the highest accuracy levels (72.6%, 68.5%) for depression and anxiety respectively. Thus, the Random Forest had the best performance in classifying and predicting the student's depression and anxiety. The results showed that school violence and bullying, home violence, academic performance, and family income were the most important factors affecting depression and anxiety scales CONCLUSIONS Overall, machine learning proved to be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated factors that influence student depression and anxiety.

Data were collected from a convenience sample of 605 students from a private university in Mexico with the eComplexity instrument. In this study, we consider the following data analyses: 1) predict students’ gender based on their perception of complex thinking competency and sub-competencies from a 25 items questionnaire, 2) analyze models’ performance during training and testing stages, and 3) study the models’ prediction bias through a confusion matrix analysis. Our results confirm the hypothesis that the four machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Multi-layer Perception, and One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network) can find sufficient differences in the eComplexity data to classify correctly up to 96.94% and 82.14% of the students’ gender in the training and testing stage, respectively. The confusion matrix analysis revealed partiality in gender prediction among all machine learning models, even though we have applied an oversampling method to reduce the imbalance dataset. It showed that the most frequent error was to predict Male students as Female class. This paper provides empirical support for analyzing perception data through machine learning models in survey research. This work proposed a novel educational practice based on developing complex thinking competency and machine learning models to facilitate educational itineraries adapted to the training needs of each group to reduce social gaps existing due to gender.",

This study aims to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms in predicting TB patient recovery rates based on clinical data obtained from healthcare facilities in Indonesia. Evaluation results indicate that the model achieved very high precision scores (100%) for the \"Deceased,\" \"Transferred,\" and \"Default\" categories; however, these findings require critical interpretation due to the likely class imbalance in those categories. In contrast, for the \"Recovered\" and \"Completed\" categories—where data instances were more numerous—the model exhibited lower precision and recall values (below 90%), reflecting challenges in accurately predicting majority classes. These results suggest that despite seemingly high numerical performance, model predictions can be biased if class distribution is not appropriately considered. The main contribution of this research lies in providing a comparative analysis of two widely used machine learning algorithms in predicting TB recovery outcomes, while emphasizing the importance of addressing data imbalance issues in clinical predictive modeling. The findings provide a practical basis for integrating predictive algorithms into clinical workflows, enabling more accurate monitoring of patient recovery and timely adjustments of TB treatment plans in Indonesia.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Heart disease is still at the top of the list of causes of deaths around the globe, which shows that there is a great need for early and accurate diagnostic methods that will aid clinical decision-making. A machine learning–based predictive system for heart disease will be developed and evaluated in this project using a real-world Heart Failure Prediction dataset that contains 918 anonymized patient records and 11 clinical attributes. As part of data preprocessing, medically impossible values were identified and treated, invalid cholesterol readings were replaced with the median, non-sensical entries were removed, categorical variables were encoded, and feature standardization was done to ready the dataset for model training. Accordingly, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel, and Random Forest were three supervised learning algorithms implemented to evaluate their performances in binary classification. To guarantee data quality and model trustworthiness, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cross-validation were done. Model performance evaluation included the use of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC–AUC metrics. The results indicate that the Random Forest classifier produced the best overall performance with an accuracy of 87.50%, precision of 91.59%, recall of 87.50%, F1-score of 89.50%, and an AUC of 0.9391, thus beating both SVM and Logistic Regression. Though Logistic Regression gave a comprehensible baseline, its greater false-negative rate made it less suitable for high-risk clinical applications. SVM displayed excellent non-linear classification power but needed more computational tuning. Taken together, these results show that Random Forest is the most dependable and robust model for heart disease prediction with this dataset. The next step should be incorporating wider lifestyle factors, using improved data collection methods, sophisticated outlier handling, additional machine learning models, and possibly deployment as a clinical decision-support tool through web or mobile applications.</jats:p>",

The timely prediction of diabetes is crucial for early intervention and management. This study explores the comparative effectiveness of four machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in identifying diabetes cases using a large public dataset containing 100,000 patient records obtained from open source Kaggle. The dataset includes nine clinical variables, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose level, and HbA1c levels, among others. To address class imbalance, which showed less than 10% positive (diabetic) cases initially, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied exclusively to the training data after an 80:20 stratified split. All models were evaluated using 5-fold stratified cross-validation, measuring their performance through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and training time. Among the models, Random Forest achieved the highest classification accuracy (96.88%) and AUC (99.70%), indicating superior overall performance. Furthermore, McNemar statistical tests revealed that the differences in performance between Random Forest and the other models were statistically significant. An analysis of feature importance highlighted that HbA1c, glucose level, and BMI were the most influential predictors. These results demonstrate that Random Forest offers the most balanced combination of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness, making it highly suitable for real-world clinical screening scenarios where early detection of diabetes is critical.</jats:p>",

This study evaluates the predictive capacity of machine learning models—Ridge regression, LASSO regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to classify opioid involvement among 11,979 de-identified overdose cases recorded between 2012 and 2021. After rigorous preprocessing, stratified train–test splits, and hyperparameter optimization, model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and calibration metrics. All models demonstrated strong predictive utility, with Random Forest and SVM offering slightly better discrimination compared to penalized regressions, though at the cost of interpretability. LASSO identified key demographic and geographic predictors, including place of death and race/ethnicity, providing actionable insights for public health interventions. Findings highlight the potential of machine learning to enhance surveillance, risk stratification, and targeted resource allocation in combating the opioid crisis in Connecticut.</p>",

Therefore, identifying DHSs in uncharacterized DNA sequences is crucial for understanding their biological functions and mechanisms. Although many experimental methods have been proposed to identify DHSs, they have proven to be expensive for genome-wide application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods for DHS prediction. In this study, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for predicting DHSs, called DHSpred (DNase I Hypersensitive Site predictor in human DNA sequences), which was trained with 174 optimal features. The optimal combination of features was identified from a large set that included nucleotide composition and di- and trinucleotide physicochemical properties, using a random forest algorithm. DHSpred achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient and accuracy of 0.660 and 0.871, respectively, which were 3% higher than those of control SVM predictors trained with non-optimized features, indicating the efficiency of the feature selection method. Furthermore, the performance of DHSpred was superior to that of state-of-the-art predictors.

With these advancements, access to information has become faster and easier; however, this convenience also introduces challenges, particularly concerning personal data security. One common cybercrime is email phishing, where attackers use malicious links to encrypt user data or devices and demand a ransom to restore access. Phishing emails often resemble official messages from trusted sources, making recipients unaware of the potential threat. To minimize such risks, technology can be utilized to automatically classify phishing emails. This study focuses on developing a machine learning model for automatic phishing email classification. The dataset used consists of 18,650 emails, including 11,322 non-phishing and 7,328 phishing emails. The proposed models employ two algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. To optimize performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using GridSearchCV. The experimental results demonstrate that the SVM algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.27%, while the Random Forest algorithm achieved 96.51%.

Accurate early diagnosis is very important to provide information that can accelerate the treatment process and reduce complications in the mother and baby. One of the machine learning methods that can be used to predict GDM is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. This study aims to compare, and evaluate GDM disease prediction models using the SVM and RF algorithms by balancing the target data using the Random Undersampling Technique. The approach using the random undersampling technique managed to increase accuracy by 18% from the accuracy before using the random undersampling technique. The SVM model in this study also uses hyperparameter tuning with kernel parameters, C (cost), and gamma, while the RF model uses Scoring Metrix and four other parameters, namely N_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf. The best parameter search process is carried out using GridSearchCV on both models. The results of the study showed that the SVM classification model with random undersampling technique and hyperparameter tuning with K-Fold achieved an average accuracy of 100% with precision, recall, f1-score values also reaching 100%, with the Best Parameter Kernel Linear, C value = 0.1 and gamma value = 0.001 reaching the highest accuracy of 1.0, with a ROC-AUC value of 99% indicating very good prediction performance. While the RF model showed an accuracy result of 99%, tuning was also carried out using the appropriate parameters resulting in the same accuracy of 99%, with a ROC-AUC value of 99% as well. From both models, it shows that the SVM and RF algorithms have very good prediction performance in predicting DMG, but the SVM algorithm can predict DMG better than RF because the number of prediction errors is lower. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we evaluate the application of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine as machine learning algorithms for predicting foetal health based on various foetal health data. 2,114 records from cardiotocography (CTG) assessments of foetal heart rate and uterine contractions make up the dataset used in this investigation. Using a variety of performance indicators, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, we assess the abilities of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict foetal health. In order to diagnose and treat foetuses who may have health issues early on, it is essential to do research into foetal health prediction. In this study, we examine the performance of Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, two well-known machine learning algorithms, at predicting foetal health. To train and evaluate our models, we used the CTG dataset, which includes foetal heart rate recordings. Our findings show that both algorithms are highly accurate at predicting foetal health, with Random Forest slightly outperforming Support Vector Machine in this regard. Furthermore, our research demonstrates that in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, the Random Forest approach surpasses the Support Vector Machine technique. Based on our research, Random Forest might be a good algorithm for predicting foetal health in clinical situations.</jats:p>",

First, the data quality is improved through preliminary data preprocessing, including the establishment of binary features, categorical variable conversion, missing value processing and lifetime zero value processing. Then COX regression is used to check whether there is a high-dimensional problem in the data, and the stability of the model is improved by multicollinearity test. Then the Lasso regression model is trained to screen significant feature variables and improve the model performance. In the random forest model, the parameters are adjusted by Out-of-Bag (OBB) error rate analysis, and the optimal model is obtained. In SVM model, the optimal penalty parameter and kernel function parameter are determined by cross-validation of optimization parameters. When evaluating the prediction rate of the model, the accuracy rate is taken as the main reference index, and the Lasso-Cox regression, RF and SVM are analyzed in detail. The results show that the RF model in this study has the highest accuracy. The results suggest that RF model may be more suitable for clinical indicators to predict Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. In the future, larger data sets can be utilized for validation, and the model content can be improved to further optimize and improve the prediction accuracy.

Experimental results show that the SVM algorithm achieved the highest accuracy at 88.84%, outperforming Random Forest which obtained 80.39%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SVM in handling high-dimensional text data for fake review detection. The study contributes to the application of automated topic modeling (LDA) for labeling e-commerce reviews in the Indonesian context and opens opportunities for further enhancement using larger datasets and deep learning-based models to improve classification accuracy and scalability.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Stunting is a serious global health problem, particularly in developing countries. Its prevalence is high in Indonesia, reaching approximately 24.4% among children under five in 2021. This condition, defined as failure to thrive due to chronic malnutrition, repeated infections, and a lack of psychosocial stimulation, has long-term impacts on an individual's cognitive development and productive capacity. This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms in predicting stunting in children, with a focus on evaluating the impact of hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search on model performance. This study used the public stunting dataset from Kaggle and included data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, duplication, encoding, and scaling. The data was then divided into 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation. Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were also used to assess model performance. Grid Search optimization was applied to both models to find the best hyperparameter combination. Experimental results showed that Grid Search optimization significantly improved the accuracy of the SVM model from 94.29% to 98.37%. Meanwhile, the Random Forest model demonstrated very high performance, achieving 99.59% accuracy both before and after Grid Search optimization. These findings underscore the significant potential of machine learning models in supporting stunting prevention efforts for public health intervention policies. This research contributes to the development of machine learning-based decision support systems for public health, particularly in early detection and intervention strategies for stunting. </jats:p>",

Within this piece of work, we design and evaluate a hybrid machine-learning pipeline integrating Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers by soft voting to detect cardiac arrest occurrences from a publicly available dataset of 303 patient records with 13 clinical features. After median imputation and data cleaning, continuous features were normalized and the cohort was divided into 70 % training and 30 % test sets. RF scored 97 % with an AUC of 1.00 on its own, and SVM scored at 95 % with an AUC of 0.97. The hybrid ensemble matched RF's perfect AUC but slightly improved recall on positive instances with enhanced sensitivity while maintaining specificity. Permutation-based and Gini-based feature-importance analysis identified major-vessel count, chest-pain type, and peak heart rate as the most important predictors. Distribution plots and heatmaps of correlations further elucidated associations between clinical measures and event status. The proposed hybrid approach is an effective, interpretable way to stratify risk early in high-risk patient populations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "Digital health applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) are a promising opportunity to address the widening gap between available resources and mental health needs globally. Increasingly, passively acquired data from wearables are augmented with carefully selected active data from depressed individuals to develop Machine Learning (ML) models of depression based on mood scores. However, most ML models are black box in nature, and hence the outputs are not explainable. Depression is also multimodal, and the reasons for depression may vary significantly between individuals. Explainable and personalised models will thus be beneficial to clinicians to determine the main features that lead to a decline in the mood state of a depressed individual, thus enabling suitable personalised therapy. This is currently lacking. Therefore, this study presents a methodology for developing personalised and accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based predictive mood models for depression, along with novel methods for identifying the key facets that lead to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. We illustrate our approach by using an existing multimodal dataset containing longitudinal Ecological Momentary Assessments of depression, lifestyle data from wearables and neurocognitive assessments for 14 mild to moderately depressed participants over one month. We develop classification- and regression-based DL models to predict participants’ current mood scores—a discrete score given to a participant based on the severity of their depressive symptoms. The models are trained inside eight different evolutionary-algorithm-based optimisation schemes that optimise the model parameters for a maximum predictive performance. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is used to verify the DL model’s predictive performance against 10 classical ML-based models, with a model error as low as 6% for some participants. We use the best model from the optimisation process to extract indicators, using SHAP, ALE and Anchors from explainable AI literature to explain why certain predictions are made and how they affect mood. These feature insights can assist health professionals in incorporating personalised interventions into a depressed individual’s treatment regimen.",

Traditional and clinical approaches and patient hesitancy make it difficult to detect and prevent this disorder, despite its widespread prevalence. This research provides an alternative approach for predicting postpartum depression based on the analysis of online comments using social media text analysis as a way to prevent direct interaction with health care providers, especially in the diagnostic stage. Collection of data from Reddit was performed due to the anonymity of the user, which creates a more closed environment to vent all kinds of emotions and the implementation of a process with IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding helped extract related emotions and sentiments from text data. Classification of users into their state of depression with some classification models based on the sentiments and emotions score percentage was a valuable contribution in understanding the postpartum depression progress. This research provides a new approach to predict, detect, and potentially diagnose the early stages of PPD, possibly providing a path forward for the development of research and resources provided to mothers, referring to mental health-related issues, and how the increase or decrease of some emotions can affect depression more than others. Considering the issue of sarcasm detection and the cost of some tools as some limitations, this study will help encourage more research into the analysis of online texts for a better understanding and treatment of this maternal mood disorder.",

    "abstract_findings": "Objective To explore the risk factors that affect adolescents’ suicidal and self-injurious behaviors and to construct a prediction model for adolescents’ suicidal and self-injurious behaviors based on machine learning algorithms. Methods Stratified cluster sampling was used to select high school students in Chongqing, yielding 3,000 valid questionnaires. Based on whether students had engaged in suicide or self-injury, they were categorized into a suicide/self-injury group (n=78) and a non-suicide/self-injury group (n=2,922). Gender, age, insomnia, and mental illness data were compared between the two groups, and a logistic regression model was used to analyze independent risk factors for adolescent suicidal and self-injurious behavior. Six methods—multi-level perceptron, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting—were used to build predictive models. Various model indicators for suicidal and self-injurious behavior were compared across the six algorithms using a confusion matrix to identify the optimal model. Result In the self-injury and suicide groups, the proportions of male adolescents, late adolescence, insomnia, and mental illness were significantly higher than in the non-suicide and self-injury groups (p <0.05). Compared with the non-suicidal self-injury group, this group also showed significantly increased scores in cognitive subscales, impulsivity, psychoticism, introversion–extroversion, neuroticism, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, and paranoia (p <0.05). These statistically significant variables were analyzed in a logistic regression model, revealing that gender, impulsivity, psychoticism, neuroticism, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and paranoia are independent risk factors for adolescent suicide and self-injury. The logistic regression model achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity in predicting adolescent suicide and self-injury behavior (0.9948 and 0.9981, respectively). Performance of the random forest, multi-level perceptron, and extreme gradient models was acceptable, while the K-nearest neighbor algorithm and support vector machine performed poorly. Conclusion The detection rate of suicidal and self-injurious behaviors is higher in women than in men. Adolescents displaying impulsiveness, psychoticism, neuroticism, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and paranoia have a greater likelihood of engaging in such behaviors. The machine learning model for classifying and predicting adolescent suicide and self-injury risk effectively identifies these behaviors, enabling targeted interventions.",

    "abstract_findings": "The increasing rate of cesarean sections worldwide poses a significant public health concern, often resulting from uncertainty in clinical decision-making rather than strict medical necessity. Obstetricians are frequently challenged by the complexity of interpreting diverse maternal and fetal indicators, leading to delayed or inappropriate interventions. Hence, accurate and early prediction of the mode of delivery is critical to safeguarding the health of both mother and child while also minimizing unnecessary surgical procedures. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based clinical decision support framework that leverages two real-world healthcare datasets—Maternal Health Risk and Fetal Health. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained on the maternal dataset to evaluate risk factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose levels. Simultaneously, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is applied to the fetal dataset to capture temporal trends in features derived from cardiotocographic (CTG) signals. Both models are designed to classify cases into two categories: normal delivery or cesarean section. Experimental results indicate that the ANN model achieves an accuracy of 94% with an AUC of 0.96, while the LSTM model attains 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.94. These results show that using AI models can help doctors make better, data-based decisions, which leads to better care for mothers and fewer unnecessary procedures.",

    "abstract_findings": "Maternal mental health during pregnancy is a crucial area of research due to its profound impact on both maternal and child well-being. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to predicting and monitoring psychological health risks in pregnant women using advanced machine learning techniques. The study employs a systematic methodology including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model implementation. Data collection was conducted at Majidia Hospital, involving a diverse sample of 70,000 pregnant women recruited through antenatal clinics, online health platforms, community outreach programs, and telephone surveys using structured questionnaires. Participants were selected across all pregnancy trimesters to ensure a representative demographic, capturing variations in age, educational background, occupational status, and parity. A diverse set of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were evaluated alongside ensemble methods to achieve robust and reliable predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest model consistently outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 97.82% ± 0.03%, precision of 97.82% ± 0.03%, recall of 100.00% ± 0.00%, and an F1 score of 96.81% ± 0.02%. SVM and Decision Tree classifiers also showed strong performance, with accuracy scores of 93.79% ± 0.01% and 91.82% ± 0.03%, respectively. Furthermore, ensemble methods enhanced predictive performance, highlighting their ability to balance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In regression tasks, the Random Forest Regressor achieved near-perfect predictions with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.5767 × 10−8 and an R2 score of 1.000, underscoring its superior predictive capabilities. Additionally, a custom loss function integrating Cross-Entropy Loss and an F1 Score Penalty was introduced to address class imbalance and enhance model performance. The training process, conducted over 10 epochs, demonstrated consistent loss reduction, with the lowest recorded loss at epoch 8 (2.4382), reflecting effective learning and parameter tuning. This study envisions the development of an intelligent, web-based tool aimed at revolutionizing psychological health assessment and support for pregnant women. This tool will not only provide early diagnosis and intervention but also recommend personalized yoga practices and natural remedies to improve maternal mental health and overall wellbeing. These findings highlight the potential of AI-driven innovations in enhancing maternal care through holistic and accessible technological solutions.",

Conventional diagnostic methods are often expensive, time-consuming, and influenced by stigma and limited accessibility, discouraging many from seeking timely help. Early identification plays a crucial role in preventing severe developments and supporting overall well-being. In order to solve such issues, we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML)-driven system that evaluates mental health status based on responses to a thoughtfully crafted survey using clinically recognized psychological indicators. This approach leverages dynamic ensemble selection techniques like KNORA-U and KNORA-E, along with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Achieving an accuracy of 81%, our model outperforms conventional methods and highlights the potential of combining explainable AI with adaptive ensemble strategies.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of predictive models incorporating placental biomarkers such as placental growth factor (PlGF), increasing early detection accuracy from 47% with traditional methods to as high as 75% in early gestation. Early identification enables timely interventions – including low-dose aspirin, increased monitoring, and planned delivery – that can significantly reduce adverse outcomes. While biomarker-based AI models require infrastructure investment, their integration into healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited settings, offers substantial cost-effectiveness and the potential to reduce preventable deaths. Successful implementation depends on accurate data collection, workforce training, standardized biomarker assays, and ongoing model validation across diverse populations.

Thus, early detection is crucial since this may avert a poor outcome either for the mother or the fetas. These conditions are generally diagnosed using the biochemical markers such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and freethyroxine which, are insensitive in identifying sub clinical cases, rendering them largely ineffective. This is countered by the predictive analysis embedded in the machine learning (ML) technique of random forests and neural networks for an accelerated diagnosis. By blending the clinical data with demographic and lifestyle factors, these ML models reveal latent patterns often masked by conventional methods, thus guiding personalized treatment options. The present study discusses how fetal health monitoring at the first and second trimesters is being transformed by predictive analytic. The utilization of AI-based diagnostics can promote the evolution of antenatal care into a real-time risk assessment with immediate medical intervention, ultimately ameliorating maternal and fetal health outcomes.",

In this study, we extracted 2,663 hospitalized adult patient records from UC Davis Medical Center archives between January 2010 and April 2020 to identify patients at high risk of OIRD. For this purpose, we employed clinical language models (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and GatorTron) and fine-tuned them on the OIRD dataset. Additionally, we leveraged the capabilities of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, to select the most informative risk factors and enhance the accuracy of the predictive models.",

    "abstract_findings": "This Depression is a common mental disorder that strongly influences the quality of life (QoL) of a person, with impacts on physical, emotional, and social aspects. Conventional techniques for evaluating the correlation between depression and QoL usually employ subjective self- reported questionnaires that are prone to inaccuracy and variability. In order to overcome these disadvantages, this study presents a machine learningbased healthcare system that uses high-level data analytics to analyze the correlation between depression and QoL. The system incorporates clinical information, behavioral trends, and psychological tests to construct predictive models that yield objective insights into the effects of depression on a person's everyday functioning. Using supervised and unsupervised learning methods, the system is able to discern trends in large data sets, enabling the early recognition of high-risk individuals. The designed framework integrates numerous machine learning methods, including deep learning, decision trees, and ensemble techniques, to improve the accuracy of prediction. Natural language processing (NLP) strategies are utilized for processing textual data from electronic health records and social media to facilitate real-time observation of depressive symptoms. Through this research, not only does AI-powered healthcare move a step forward in assessing mental health but also sets the stage for intelligent systems to facilitate linicians and patients in decision-making for better well-being.",

Objective, multimodal biomarkers offer a promising route toward earlier and more accurate detection. Electroencephalography (EEG) captures real-time neural dynamics, while genetic biomarkers provide stable indicators of molecular predisposition, offering complementary perspectives on depression risk. This study introduces EEG–Gene Fusion Depression Network (EGF-DepNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework to integrate EEG-derived features and gene-based biomarkers for depression prediction. Two fusion strategies are proposed: (i) an Attention Fusion model employing cross-modal MultiHeadAttention within a compact Conv1D network, and (ii) a Transformer Fusion model that encodes EEG and genomic embeddings as tokens in a lightweight self-attention encoder. Using the ICBrainDB dataset, both architectures achieved high predictive performance, with Transformer Fusion outperforming Attention Fusion across multiple evaluation metrics, including F1-score (0.727 vs. 0.600) and AUC (0.845 vs. 0.749). Results demonstrate that multimodal EEG–genomic integration improves classification robustness over unimodal approaches, effectively leveraging the temporal sensitivity of EEG and the trait stability of genetic markers. This work advances the development of biologically informed, AI-driven diagnostic tools, offering a pathway toward more precise, scalable, and personalized approaches in precision psychiatry.",

Traditional prediction methods in maternal-foetal medicine often rely on subjective clinical judgment and limited statistical models, which may not fully capture complex patient data. By integrating computational innovation with mechanistic biology and rigorous clinical validation, AI can finally fulfil the promise of precision obstetrics by transforming pregnancy complications into a preventable, personalised continuum of care. This study aims to map the current landscape of AI applications across the continuous spectrum of maternal–foetal health, identify the types of models used, and compare clinical targets and performance, potential pitfalls, and strategies to translate innovation into clinical impact. Methods: A literature search of peer-reviewed studies that employ AI for prediction, diagnosis, or decision support in Obstetrics was conducted. AI algorithms were categorised by application area: foetal monitoring, prediction of preterm birth, prediction of pregnancy complications, and/or labour and delivery. Results: AI-driven models consistently demonstrate superior performance to traditional approaches. Nevertheless, their widespread clinical adoption is hindered by limited dataset diversity, “black-box” algorithms, and inconsistent reporting standards. Conclusions: AI holds transformative potential to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes through earlier diagnosis, personalised risk assessment, and automated monitoring. To fulfil this promise, the field must prioritize the creation of large, diverse, open-access datasets, mandate transparent, explainable model architectures, and establish robust ethical and regulatory frameworks. By addressing these challenges, AI can become an integral, equitable, and trustworthy component of Obstetric care worldwide.",

    "abstract_findings": "Do differences in maternal age distributions contribute to the variability in the discrimination performance of an embryo viability model based on artificial intelligence (AI)? Using a common reference age distribution, enables a less biased and thus more standardized comparison of embryo implantation prediction between clinics. Studies from different clinics have shown a quite large variation in the performance of the same AI model. The most common method of comparing performance between clinics is to use simple clinic-specific performance statistics while ignoring dissimilarities between clinics in patient cohorts, culture conditions etc. A more appropriate method is meta-analysis of performance across clinics rather than using overall performance, however, this does also not account for dissimilarities between clinics. Assessing the performance in subgroups, although common practice, reduces the sample size significantly and limits interpretation to each separate subgroup. This is a retrospective observational multi-site study with data from four clinics collected over varying time periods. In all participating clinics embryos were cultured in EmbryoScope time-lapse incubators (ES-D, ES+, ES-Flex; Vitrolife). Embryo implantation likelihood was evaluated with the iDAScore v1.0 AI decision support tool. Data from 4,805 single embryo transfers on day 5 and 6 (fresh and frozen) with known fetal heartbeat outcome were included. Donor egg cycles were strictly excluded. Performance of embryo implantation prediction was measured in terms of areas under the ROC curve (AUC). To account for age differences, we performed a standardization of the AUCs using a weighted version of the ROC curves with weights defined as the ratio between the age densities in a reference population and in the specific clinic. The reference population was comprised of data that was held out from the original model development. Different age distributions with medians ranging from 32 to 40 years were observed in the four clinics. The unweighted overall AUC was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.69), whereas the AUC in the reference population was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.71). The predictive performance of the iDAScore model varied between clinics with the unweighted AUCs ranging from 0.58 to 0.69. Meta-analysis across all four clinics showed a summary average of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.70). We then standardized to the age distribution in a reference population in which the maternal age ranged from 21 to 44 years with a median of 38. The values of the AUCs after standardization ranged from 0.60 to 0.71 between clinics with a summary average of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.72). The standard error of the summary average was 5% lower when standardization was used and the estimated variation between clinics in the meta-analysis was 16% lower. In conclusion, we have shown with our standardized analysis method that the variability in embryo performance prediction between clinics can be partially explained by the difference in maternal age distributions. The summary average of the AUC is highly dependent on the age distribution in the chosen reference population. Therefore, the exact value of this estimate should be interpreted with caution. However, comparing AUCs between clinics using this standardization approach is less biased by differences in age distribution. Simple comparisons of the performance of AI-based embryo implantation prediction in different clinics may be influenced by factors such as age. Using a standardization approach, this influence can be mitigated, enabling a less biased comparison. Differences in other important factors apart from age can potentially also be considered. not applicable",

We hypothesized depression symptom scores would decrease from admission and then increase from discharge to 30 days. METHODS Prospective longitudinal cohort study of premature infants in NICU. Parents completed the validated Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4 time points: NICU admission, discharge, and 14 days and 30 days postdischarge. EPDS score change across time and probability of a positive screen (EPDS ≥10) were by assessed using mixed effect regression models. RESULTS Of 431 parents enrolled (mothers, n = 230 [53%]), 33% of mothers (n = 57) and 17% of fathers (n = 21) had a positive EPDS screening. Score change was 1.9 points different between mothers and fathers (confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–2.6; P < .0001), with mothers decreasing 2.9 points (CI: 2.1–3.7; P < .0001) and fathers decreasing 1.0 points (CI: 0.1–2.0; P = .04). Over time, mothers decreased 10.96 times (CI: 2.99–38.20; P = .0003); fathers decreased at a nonsignificant rate. Admission or discharge screening improved 30-day depressive symptom prediction (AUC 0.66 baseline demographics only versus 0.84+initial [P < .0001], and versus 0.80+discharge screening [P < .001]). CONCLUSIONS Mothers and fathers experience different depressive symptom trajectories from NICU to home. Screening parents for postpartum depression during the NICU stay is likely to result in improved identification of parents at risk for postpartum depression after discharge. Focused attention on fathers appears warranted.",

This study aimed to summarize studies that reported an association between stress exposure and AD development in later life. Methods and findings A comprehensive literature search was performed using online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for articles published up to May 1, 2023. Eligible studies were screened and selected based on the inclusion criteria. We incorporated cohort or case‐control studies published in English which explored the relationship between stress experienced by parents or children and AD. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated according to the type of stress using a random‐effects model. Twenty‐two studies were included. AD was related to maternal distress (OR 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.13–1.47), maternal anxiety (OR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.18–1.46), and negative life events (OR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.46–2.76). Maternal depression during pregnancy was associated with AD (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.33), whereas no significant association was found for postpartum depression. Research on stress experienced by paternal or children is scare. Conclusions Early maternal stress may potentially elevate the risk of AD in their offspring. Importantly, rigorously designed studies are required to corroborate the link between maternal stress and AD in children. These studies should aim to gather insights about the impact of stress during specific trimesters of pregnancy, postnatal stress, and paternal stress, and to identify potential prevention strategies.",

The mothers completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, State Anxiety Inventory and Perceived Stress Scale: biweekly up to 14 times during pregnancy; once in infancy (at child age 4–12 months); and once in late childhood (at child age 7–11 years). They also completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised at the infancy (n = 2538) and Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire at the late childhood (n = 2004; 1693 children had data at both follow‐ups) follow‐up on child negative affectivity, extraversion and effortful control. We examined the associations of maternal distress with child temperament with linear regression, linear mixed and Bayesian relevant lifecourse exposure models. Results Maternal distress during pregnancy was associated with higher negative affectivity and lower effortful control in children in infancy and late childhood. Maternal distress during pregnancy was also associated with increases in negative affectivity, decreases in effortful Control, and smaller decreases in extraversion from infancy to late childhood.

A systematic scoping review of 39 AI/ML techniques revealed that none had achieved an acceptable level of clinician acceptance. To address this issue, we propose a human-centered design approach, emphasizing clinical decision-making, workflow alignment, and potential maternal morbidity. Our multi-phase strategy actively engages stakeholders, including OB care providers, to refine system prototypes while considering usability, explainability, trust, and cultural sensitivity. The research aims to establish a roadmap for the future development of high-risk maternal health prediction models.In the first phase (Aim 1), we identify system requirements through stakeholder engagement and literature review, uncovering significant pain points, including communication delays, poor information flow, and the lack of AI/ML tools in practice. The study highlights the importance of addressing these challenges to optimize clinical outcomes.The second phase (Aim 2) focuses on designing AI/ML architectures, aligning system features with HF principles and ensuring standardized data across clinics. Co-designing tools with OB providers resulted in solutions such as smart-SBAR for shift changes and patient-engagement strategies that enhance cultural sensitivity. Providers expressed a strong preference for decision-support tools that complement rather than replace clinical judgment, with transparency in AI outputs seen as critical to building trust.Aim 3, which is ongoing, involves the prototyping and testing of AI/ML tools within clinical workflows, focusing on usability and alignment with existing practices. Preliminary findings suggest that transparent, interpretable AI outputs, along with streamlined workflows, significantly improve clinician trust and utility.In the final phase (Aim 4), the study evaluates both formative and summative aspects of the AI/ML tools, assessing their impact on clinical decision-making, trust, and maternal health outcomes. The evaluation methodology involves assessing model performance, clinician feedback, and model accuracy in simulated environments.By incorporating human factors methods into the development of AI/ML tools for high-risk OB care, the study aims to improve clinician acceptance, enhance decision-making processes, and streamline workflows. These findings contribute to the broader adoption of AI/ML tools in maternal healthcare, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes and patient care efficiency.",

This study develops an AI-driven diagnostic pipeline that fuses demographic, behavioral, and social determinants of health to predict risk for major mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using a population-scale dataset of over 10,000 anonymized health records combining age, sex, BMI, income, education, and lifestyle behaviors, we benchmark five machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), across both unbalanced and SMOTE-balanced conditions. The evaluation integrates multiple dimensions: discrimination (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC), calibration (Brier score, reliability curves), and fairness across demographic subgroups (sex, rural–urban classification). SHAP-based explainability is employed to interpret model behavior and to identify dominant risk predictors and interaction effects, while robustness checks probe performance under covariate shifts and synthetic missingness. Results show that ensemble and deep models outperform classical baselines, with XGBoost achieving an average ROC-AUC of 0.90 and strong calibration stability. Income level, alcohol consumption, and BMI category emerge as top predictors, reflecting known epidemiological associations. Subgroup analysis demonstrates consistent performance across demographic segments, underscoring model fairness and generalizability. Collectively, the findings illustrate how interpretable AI can enhance early detection and risk stratification for mental health conditions, providing a data-driven foundation for preventive interventions, policy guidance, and equitable digital mental health systems in the United States.",

    "abstract_findings": "Introduction Mental disorders are highly prevalent in modern society, leading to substantial personal and societal burdens. Among these, depression is one of the most common, often exacerbated by socioeconomic, clinical, and individual risk factors. With the rise of social media, user-generated content offers valuable opportunities for the early detection of mental disorders through computational approaches. Methods This study explores the early detection of depression using black-box machine learning (ML) models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), N-grams, Bag of Words (BoW), and GloVe embeddings were employed to extract linguistic and semantic features. To address the interpretability limitations of black-box models, Explainable AI (XAI) methods were integrated, specifically the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Results Experimental findings demonstrate that SVM achieved the highest accuracy in detecting depression from social media data, outperforming RF and other models. The application of LIME enabled granular insights into model predictions, highlighting linguistic markers strongly aligned with established psychological research. Discussion Unlike most prior studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, this work emphasizes both predictive performance and interpretability. The integration of LIME not only enhanced transparency and interpretability but also improved the potential clinical trustworthiness of ML-based depression detection models.",

    "abstract_findings": "Abstract Background Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally, affecting approximately 280 million people and frequently going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The growing ubiquity of wearable devices enables continuous monitoring of activity levels, providing a new avenue for data-driven detection and severity assessment of depression. However, existing machine learning models often exhibit lower performance when distinguishing overlapping subtypes of depression and frequently lack explainability, an essential component for clinical acceptance. Objective This study aimed to develop and evaluate an interpretable machine learning framework for detecting depression and classifying its severity using wearable-actigraphy data, while addressing common challenges such as imbalanced datasets and limited model transparency. Methods We used the Depresjon dataset and applied Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) to mitigate class imbalance. We extracted multiple statistical features (eg, power spectral density mean and autocorrelation) and demographic attributes (eg, age) from the raw activity data. Five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks) were assessed via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and Matthew correlation constant. We further used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to elucidate prediction drivers. Results XGBoost achieved the highest overall accuracy of 84.94% for binary classification and 85.91% for multiclass severity. SHAP and LIME revealed power spectral density mean, age, and autocorrelation as top predictors, highlighting circadian disruptions’ role in depression. Conclusions Our interpretable framework reliably identifies depressed versus nondepressed individuals and differentiates mild from moderate depression. The inclusion of SHAP and LIME provides transparent, clinically meaningful insights, emphasizing the potential of explainable artificial intelligence to enhance early detection and intervention strategies in mental health care.",

The study’s primary objective was to assess the accuracy of novel high-risk factors using MLA in predicting preeclampsia. The study included 400 pregnant women and used 27 novel high-risk factors to predict preeclampsia. The target variables for predicting preeclampsia are systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Various algorithms, including DT, RF, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-Neighbors, LGBM, MLP, Ada Boost Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier are used in the analysis. The accuracy and precision of the LGBM Classifier (0.85 and 0.9583 with F1 0.7188), Support Vector Classifier (0.8417 and 0.92 with F1 0.7077), Decision Tree (0.825 and 0.913 with F1 0.6667), and Extra Trees (0.8167 and 0.9091 with F1 0.6452) are found to be better algorithms for prediction of preeclampsia than those of the other models used in the study. According to the novel high-risk factors score, 17.5% of pregnant women were identified as being at high risk for preeclampsia during the first trimester, which increased to 18.7% in 3rd trimester; in addition, 16% of pregnant women had a BP of 140/90 mmHg and the above.

Therefore, there is a need to provide an explanation of the model to machine-learning professionals to establish trust in the model prediction and provide a human-understandable explanation to domain specialists. This was achieved by developing a model-independent and locally accurate explanation set. This set makes the conclusions of the primary models understandable to anyone in the insurance industry, including experts and non-experts. The interpretability of this model is vital for effective human interaction with machine learning systems. It is also important to provide an individual-explained prediction that will gauge trust, in addition to completing and supporting set validations in model selection. Therefore, this study proposes the use of LIME and <bold>SHAP</bold> approaches to understand and explain a model developed using random forest regression to predict insurance premiums. The drawback of the <bold>SHAP</bold> algorithms, as indicated in these experiments, is the lengthy computing time and every possible computing combination needed to produce the findings. Additionally, the intentions of the experiments conducted were focused on the model's interpretability and explainability using <bold>LIME</bold> and <bold>SHAP</bold>, and not on insurance premium charge prediction. Two experiments were conducted, experiment one focused on interpreting the random forest regression model using <bold>LIME</bold> techniques while experiment two used the <bold>SHAP</bold> technique to interpret the model.</p>",

If the remaining mileage is not accurate, electric vehicle drivers will have no choice but have to feel anxious about the mileage. If the remaining mileage to drive is wrong, drivers may not be able to get to the charging station and may not be able to drive because the battery runs out. This study proposes a more advanced model by predicting the remaining mileage based on actual driving data and based on reflecting the pattern of customers who drive regularly. The basic model is a linear regression model, and the advanced model is a Bayesian linear regression model. In order to improve performance, the driver's regular driving pattern is recognized in advance before driving and it is reflected in the remaining driving mileage model. The actual driving log is used for the dataset. It can be seen that the performance of the model in this study is improved 10% better compared to the existing remaining driving mileage.</jats:p>",

Traditional assessment tools are widely used to identify a patient at risk of developing a PI. This study aims to construct a novel fused multi-channel prediction model of PIs in adult hospitalized patients using machine learning algorithms (MLAs). Methods: A multi-phase quantitative approach involving a case–control experimental design was used. A first-hand dataset was collected retrospectively between March/2022 and August/2023 from the electronic medical records of three hospitals in Palestine. Results: The total number of patients was 49,500. A balanced dataset was utilized with a total number of 1110 patients (80% training and 20% testing). The models that were developed utilized eight MLAs, including linear regression and support vector regression (SVR), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and extreme gradient boosting (XG boosting) and validated with five-fold cross-validation techniques. The best model was RF, for which the accuracy was 0.962, precision was 0.942, recall was 0.922, F1 was 0.931, area under curve (AUC) was 0.922, false positive rate (FPR) was 0.155, and true positive rate (TPR) was 0.782. Conclusions: The predictive factors were age, moisture, activity, length of stay (LOS), systolic blood pressure (BP), and albumin.

    "abstract_findings": "<p>While the physical health of women and children is emphasized in international policy guidelines, the mental dimensions of their health are often ignored, especially in developing countries. However, recent and strong evidence suggests that the mental and physical health of mothers and children is inextricably linked, and the one cannot be possible without the other (Prince et al. 2007). This chapter reviews the evidence and suggests directions for policy and research in this area. Depression is the fourth leading cause of disease burden and the largest cause of nonfatal burden, accounting for almost 12% of all total years lived with disability worldwide. Depression around childbirth is common, affecting approximately 10–15% of all mothers in Western societies (O’Hara and Swain 1996). Epidemiological studies from the developing world have reported increasingly high rates of postnatal depression in diverse cultures across the developing world. An early pioneering study by Cox (1979) in a semirural Ugandan tribe found rates of 10% based on the ICD-8 criteria. Two decades later, a community study by Cooper et al. (1999) in a periurban settlement in South Africa, found rates of 34.7%, an increase of over threefold. Hospital-based studies have found rates of 23% in Goa, India (Patel et al. 2002), 22% in eastern Turkey (Inandi 2002) and 15.8% in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (Goubash and Abou-Saleh 1997). A rural-community study in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, reported over 25% women suffering from depression in the antenatal period and 28% in the postnatal period (Rahman et al. 2007). Over half these women were found to be still depressed a year later (Rahman and Creed 2007). A recent meta-analysis shows that the rates in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC) are higher than high income countries, ranging from 18–25% (Fisher et al. 2012). Risk factors identified include previous psychiatric problems, life events in the previous year, poor marital relationship, lack of social support, and economic deprivation. Female infant gender was found to be an important determinant of postnatal depression in India, but not in South Africa. Importantly, postnatal depression was found to be associated with high degrees of chronicity, disability and disturbances of mother–infant relationship.</p>",

Consequently, effective diagnosis and therapy must reduce the impact of depression. There is often more than one factor at play when determining why someone has been diagnosed with depression. In addition to alcohol and substance abuse, other possible causes include problems with physical health, adverse reactions to medications, life-changing events, and social circumstances. In this paper, exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the insights of the sensorimotor database depression comprising depressive experiences in individuals who are either unipolar or bipolar. This study proposes a robust tuned extreme gradient boosting model generator to automatically predict the state of depression. The performance is optimized by determining the best combination of hyperparameters for the extreme gradient boosting model. By harnessing the power of advanced machine learning methodologies, this study underscores comparative analysis and the importance of data-driven innovation in mental health and clinical practice. Future developments for the robust tuned extreme gradient boosting model’s application and study to forecast depression in the sensorimotor database depression can be used to track changes in depressed states over time by integrating it with longitudinal and multimodal data.</jats:p>",

This study aims to develop a depression detection model based on natural language processing (NLP) technology to automatically identify potential depression patients. First, collect data from the Weibo platform using web scraping techniques, and then use NLP tools such as XLNet for in-depth analysis of the text data. In the model evaluation phase, the paper uses key metrics such as accuracy (ACC) to assess the effectiveness of NLP techniques in predicting depression. Experimental results indicate that the XLNet model performed the best among all tested models, achieving an accuracy of 81%, thus confirming the feasibility of using NLP technology for depression prediction. The significance of this study lies in providing a new method for mental health monitoring, which aids in the early detection and intervention of depression, with important social value and application prospects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>Depression is the mental disorder that prevalent in modern society, causing many people to suffer or even commit suicide. Psychiatrists and psychologists typically diagnose depression using representative tests such as the Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in conjunction with patient consultations. Traditional tests, however, are time consuming, can be trained on patients, and entail a lot of clinician subjectivity. In the present study, we trained the machine learning models using sex and age-reflected z-score values of QEEG indicators based on data from Data Center for Korean EEG with 116 potential depression subjects and 80 healthy controls. The classification model distinguished potential depression groups and normal groups with a test accuracy of up to 92.31% and a 10-fold cross validation loss of 0.13. This performance proposes a model with z-score QEEG metrics considering sex and age as an objective and a reliable method for detecting potential depression.</jats:p>",

    "abstract_findings": "<jats:p>Cryptocurrency is a new sort of asset that has emerged as a result of the advancement of financial technology and it has created a big opportunity for researches. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Around the world, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies that are used. This paper proposes three types of recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms used to predict the prices of three types of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH). The models show excellent predictions depending on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results obtained from these models show that the gated recurrent unit (GRU) performed better in prediction for all types of cryptocurrency than the long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) models. Therefore, it can be considered the best algorithm. GRU presents the most accurate prediction for LTC with MAPE percentages of 0.2454%, 0.8267%, and 0.2116% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. The bi-LSTM algorithm presents the lowest prediction result compared with the other two algorithms as the MAPE percentages are: 5.990%, 6.85%, and 2.332% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. Overall, the prediction models in this paper represent accurate results close to the actual prices of cryptocurrencies. The importance of having these models is that they can have significant economic ramifications by helping investors and traders to pinpoint cryptocurrency sales and purchasing. As a plan for future work, a recommendation is made to investigate other factors that might affect the prices of cryptocurrency market such as social media, tweets, and trading volume.</jats:p>",
